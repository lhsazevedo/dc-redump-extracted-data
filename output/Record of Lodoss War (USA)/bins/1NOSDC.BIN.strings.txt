Welcome back to the land of the\n
living, old friend!\0
My name is Wart. I understand how\n
confused you must feel right\n
now, but you must trust me. In\n
time all will become clear.\0
Now then, a new life should be\n
honored with a new name. How do\n
you wish to be known?\0
That is not an appropriate name.\n
Choose again!\0
My friend, do you remember who\n
you are? You are the the Emperor\n
of Marmo, Beld! I have a mission\n
for you!\0
\p! Approach me!\0
Do you remember how to use magic,\n
old friend?\0
No. My memory is still cloudy. Please remind\nme.
Yes, I think I remember.
Back at the Goblin Fortress you\n
read your first Book of Magic,\n
and memorized the Recall spell.\0
You are not a magic user by\n
nature, and thus you must\n
prepare any spell you intend to\n
use in advance.\0
Press and hold the X Button to\n
reach the spell selection\n
screen. From there, press the A\n
Button three times to prepare\n
the Recall spell.\0
Alright, I shall not explain any\n
more. Use the Recall spell to\n
return to the Goblin Fortress.\0
Press and hold the X Button to\n
reach the spell selection\n
screen. Once there, press the A\n
Button three times to prepare\n
the Recall spell.\0
You have prepared the Recall\n
spell and are ready to cast.\0
Now look at the top of your Item\n
Bar. You will see an icon in the\n
spell circle. This is the symbol\n
for the Recall spell.\0
The spell circle shows you what\n
spell you currently have\n
prepared. Prepared spells can be\n
cast with the X Button.\0
Tap the X Button once and you\n
will prime the Recall spell.\n
Press the X Button a second time\n
and you will cast it. Try it now.\0
Well, it seems to be working\n
properly. Do you want me to\n
explain how to use magic again?\0
No, I understand.
Yes, please explain it to me again.
Splendid! You have mastered your\n
first spell. Now let us return to\n
the Goblin Fortress. There is\n
much to do.\0
Very well.\0
I have brought you back from the\n
Realm of the Dead because I need\n
your help. We have little time,\n
but I will answer your questions\n
as best I can.\0
Who am I?
Where am I?
Why have you resurrected me, Wart?
Tell me, what must I do next?
Where am I?
Why have you resurrected me, Wart?
Tell me, what must I do next?
Who am I?
Why have you resurrected me, Wart?
Tell me, what must I do next?
Who am I?
Where am I?
Tell me, what must I do next?
Who am I?
Tell me, what must I do next?
Where am I?
Tell me, what must I do next?
Why have you resurrected me, Wart?
Tell me, what must I do next?
Tell me, what must I do next?
You do not remember? Perhaps\n
that is for the best. For now, all\n
I will say is this: you were once\n
a powerful warrior and leader.\0
You are in a tomb beneath the\n
royal cemetery on Marmo island.\n
This is where you were buried.\n
You have been dead for many\n
years.\0
These are grave times. Even as we\n
speak dark forces beyond my\n
control strive to awaken the\n
ancient Goddess of Destruction,\n
Kardis.\0
This is why I have granted you\n
new life. You were once the\n
strongest warrior on Marmo. You\n
alone are capable of stopping\n
Kardis.\0
All in good time my friend!\n
First, we must see how much of\n
your training you recall.\0
Before you can proceed you must\n
arm yourself!\0
This sword may look ordinary,\n
but in truth it has unlimited\n
potential! Eventually, you will\n
come to recognize the true power\n
it possesses.\0
Pick up the sword with the A\n
Button and follow me into the\n
next room.\0
I am protected by a magical\n
barrier. You can neither hurt me\n
nor anyone else I name.\0
I grow irritated by your games!\0
Press the START Button to access\n
the Status Page. From there,\n
equip your sword by selecting it\n
and pressing the A Button twice.\0
I see you have equipped your\n
sword. Good. You are ready for\n
your first lesson.\0
Listen to me my friend. You have\n
just been reborn. Before you can\n
embark upon your quest you must\n
first recall your training.\0
Pass through this door and head\n
up the stairs. I have prepared a\n
short seminar for you, to\n
refresh your memory.\0
We will meet again when you have\n
finished training. Don't take\n
too long, time is of the essence.\0
You have passed the ultimate\n
test. You have conquered the\n
physical manifestation of your\n
darkest fears.\0
It seems there is no-one left on\n
Marmo to challenge you. You are\n
now the mightiest warrior on\n
this island!\0
I like the sound of that! Say it again!
The mightiest warrior, except for you, Wart.
What? This was just a game? What a waste of\ntime!
I always appreciate a challenge. Thank you,\nmy friend.
I am not so sure. You have\n
vanquished foes as powerful as I\n
on your travels. But we are dear\n
friends, let us not talk of\n
fighting!\0
This was just a test? What a waste of time!
I always appreciate a challenge. Thank you,\nmy friend.
When you confront Kardis, win or\n
loose, you must die. It is your\n
destiny. But there is something\n
else you should know.\0
To resurrect Kardis, Wagnard had\n
to awaken the spirit of the dark\n
priestess Neneel from within\n
Slayn and Leila's child, Neese.\0
This is the demon you face in\n
Temple of Kardis. She will\n
attempt to take your soul if she\n
is defeated. I fear this cannot\n
be stopped. \0
But Neese survives within\n
Neneel. Even if Neeneel takes\n
your soul I believe that Neese\n
will free you in the end. You\n
will rest in piece.\0
Now I am at ease.\0
Your destiny in this life is\n
written, but the fate of your\n
soul has yet to be decided.\0
Now, let us return to the Goblin\n
Fortress.\0
Oh, I nearly forgot. I wanted to\n
give you something. A reward for\n
overcoming this final\n
challenge.\0
I shall give to you a special\n
Ancient inscription and a magic\n
wand of thunder.\0
Excellent! See you back at the\n
fortress.\0
333?
?333?
Welcome, warrior of the past! I\n
am the master of this room.\0
Wart has instructed me to teach\n
you a few basic lessons about\n
handling equipment and items.\0
First we shall test your combat\n
abilities. Attack me with your\n
sword. Do not fear, you cannot\n
harm me.\0
No, no! The A Button is to talk!\n
Press the B Button to swing your\n
sword.\0
Did Wart not tell you? Press the\n
START Button to access the\n
Status Page. Equip your sword\n
from there!\0
The chest is locked, but it is\n
made of wood. A few well placed\n
blows from your sword should do\n
the trick.\0
Pick up items from the floor\n
with the A Button. Take the suit\n
of armor and equip it.\0
Press the START Button to access\n
the Status Page. Equip the suit\n
of armor in your empty armor\n
slot.\0
What? You threw away the armor?!\n
Why?! It is an important item!\0
Sigh. I will give you another.\n
Try to be more careful with this\n
one.\0
Very good. Next I will teach you\n
about locked containers. This is\n
complicated so pay attention.\0
This chest is made of iron and\n
cannot be broken. This\n
particular chest is unlocked.\n
Open it with the A Button and\n
take out the item inside.\0
Pick up items from the floor\n
with the A Button.\0
What? You threw away the\n
Lockpick! Why? Lockpicks are a\n
valuable commodity on Marmo. \0
Sigh. I will give you another. Do\n
not throw this one away.\0
At the bottom of your Item Bar\n
you will see a Lockpick icon\n
sparkling. This is the item you\n
just collected.\0
The Lockpick is a disposable kit\n
which you can use to open any\n
locked container you encounter.\n
Let's give it a try.\0
Highlight the Lockpick using the\n
Up and Down directional keys on\n
the D-Pad then stand next to the\n
locked chest and press the Y\n
Button.\0
Empty? Don't worry. There will be\n
plenty of treasure for you to\n
discover once you start\n
exploring the island.\0
Finally, I would like to teach\n
you about using potions. Do you\n
wish to learn?\0
Yes, please explain to me how potions work.
I don't have time for these simple lessons.
Actually, I'd like you to explain everything\nto me again, from the beginning.
You are hungry to learn! That is\n
good! Take a look at the Item Bar\n
on the right of the screen.\0
I just gave you a potion. Did you\n
see it sparkle when you received\n
it?\0
No, I must of missed it.
Yes, I saw it.
Once again. Watch the Item Bar to\n
the right of the screen.\0
When you are given items, such as\n
potions, they are automatically\n
added to your inventory.\0
Potions work just like the\n
Lockpick. Highlight the potion\n
with the directional keys, and\n
use with the Y Button. Try using\n
the potion now.\0
Excellent! You are a quick\n
learner. If you understand all\n
that I have taught you then I\n
shall bid you farewell.\0
Thank you. You have taught me well.
Please explain everything to me again, from\nthe start.
What now? You threw it away\n
deliberately! Do you want to\n
succeed on your quest or not?\0
I have no time to play these\n
games with you. I will give you\n
the potion one more time.\0
Then I shall bid you farewell.\n
Just remember this. You can use\n
all items displayed in your Item\n
Bar with the Y Button. \0
Perhaps we shall meet again\n
warrior. I look forward to\n
seeing how your skills have\n
developed. Good luck!\0
Do you really want me to start\n
from the beginning?\0
Yes. Please explain everything to me from\nthe start.
No, I wish to continue.
Very well. Your wish is my\n
command.\0
Time, in the name of the great\n
Cha Za, God of Trade, turn back\n
thy hand a few moments and grant\n
us another meeting.\0
Good! You attack with great\n
skill. I sense some of your old\n
ferocity. Now, I will teach you\n
about treasure chests.\0
There is a suit of armor inside\n
that chest. Take it out and equip\n
it.\0
The magic of the great Wart\n
protects me. You cannot hurt me.\0
Hero, wait! \0
I am the spirit of this save\n
stone. Wart instructed me to\n
assist you.\0
To record your progress, stand\n
by the sacred stone and press\n
the A Button.\0
Traveler from the Realm of the\n
Dead. I have been waiting for\n
you. I am the master of this\n
room.\0
I am not as benevolent as the\n
master on the floor below. It is\n
not my intention to repeat\n
instructions or return\n
discarded items.\0
That old fool Wart has asked me\n
to teach you, and teach you I\n
shall.\0
Though I fear the lesson you\n
learn here shall be your last.\0
Citizens of the Dead, arise. This\n
man who stands before you has\n
cheated death.\0
Take him back where he belongs!\0
Inconceivable! Still, there is\n
no escape from this room. You\n
will remain here until you die...\n
again!\0
Inconceivable! How did you know\n
how to break a magic seal? Who\n
told you? It's not fair! Curse\n
you hero!\0
You wish to talk during battle?\n
You are more foolish than I\n
thought!\0
You think you can hurt me with\n
that tooth pick! Stop it!\0
Get him boys!\0
Stop! Hold it! Stay away from\n
that door!\0
If you beg me, maybe I will tell\n
you how to get out of this room.\n
Then again, maybe not.\0
Not a scratch! Hee hee! Wart is\n
true to his word, that old coot!\0
Whatever you do, don't pick up\n
that scroll on the floor. Just\n
ignore it. It has nothing to do\n
with the magic seal on that door.\0
Ok, so, you found the Decoding\n
scroll. Big deal. You probably\n
have no idea what it is for.\0
So what if the Decoding Scroll\n
works like a Lockpick? You'll\n
never figure out what to do with\n
it. That takes brains.\0
#8kE
Hello boss. Feel like a fight?\n
We've got some monsters locked\n
up down here that we need to get\n
rid of.\0
No thanks.
Who are you?
Yes, I could do with a good fight.
Suit yourself, boss.\0
I'm Gromit the prison warden. I\n
look after the monsters and\n
prisoners we keep down here in\n
the fortress dungeon.\0
Ok, the first monster we need to\n
clear out is an Ogre. He's pretty\n
strong boss. Sure can you\n
manage?\0
Hmmm. Ogres ARE strong. I think I'll pass.
Ogre Schmogre! Bring it on!
Ok, the next monster we need to\n
clear out is a Golem. They're\n
hard as nails, boss. Could be\n
dangerous.\0
I don't think I'm ready to fight a Golem just\nyet.
Come to pappa!
Alright then. I'll unlock the\n
Ogre's cell. Follow me...\0
Watch out for the Ogre's club,\n
boss! It smarts!\0
Ok, I'll unlock the Golem's cell.\n
Don't say I didn't warn you. \0
Be careful boss! The Golem's\n
attacks can knock you flat on\n
your back!\0
You're a tough one alright boss.\n
I never figured you could take\n
out both those monsters.\0
That Golem's club is good for\n
fighting against other Golems.\n
I'm sure it will come in handy.\0
Check the map with the L + R +\n
Start Buttons. There is a\n
compass at the top left of the\n
map. The red tip of the needle\n
always points north. \0
Access the Status Page with the\n
Start Button. From there, you can\n
manually place certain items\n
from your inventory in the Item\n
Bar.\0
Warrior of the past, I am the\n
spirit of this well. By order of\n
the great Wart I shall teach you\n
about healing potions.\0
The source which feeds my body\n
holds a green potion which\n
replenishes your health. It is\n
called a healing well.\0
Stand next to the well and press\n
the A Button to fill all empty\n
containers in your inventory\n
with healing potion.\0
You got here fast! I hope you\n
payed attention to the lessons I\n
prepared.\0
Still, I am pleased by your zeal.\n
It seems death has not dulled\n
your spirit!\0
You are on time. Just as I\n
expected. It seems death has not\n
dulled your spirit!\0
What took you so long? I had\n
hoped you would recall your\n
training a little quicker.\0
Ha ha ha! I was only joking. No\n
need to pull a face like that! I\n
know best what you are truly\n
capable of.\0
What took you so long? Did you\n
get lost? I have been waiting\n
here so long that I nearly grew\n
roots!\0
Now then, you must proceed to the\n
surface. However, before you can\n
get there you must overcome the\n
creatures in the next room.\0
They are strong opponents,\n
especially considering your\n
current state. But do not fear. I\n
shall assist you.\0
One word of advice: Stay clear\n
of the Ogres. You are still too\n
weak to fight them alone. Leave\n
the brutes to me.\0
Well then, old friend. Once more\n
into battle!\0
You fight with great skill, yet\n
you are still weak. Death has\n
taken its toll. Fear not though,\n
your strength will return with\n
time.\0
Nevertheless, the adventure must\n
begin. It is time for your first\n
assignment.\0
To the north of the royal\n
cemetery lies a fortress,\n
inhabited by goblins. This\n
fortress would make a useful\n
base for our operations.\0
Infiltrate the fortress\n
barracks and kill the Goblin\n
Commander. The goblins are weak\n
and will follow you if you slay\n
their leader.\0
You wish me to become an assassin?
Are you going to come with me?
Tell me again what I must do.
Killing a goblin troubles you?\n
Ha! In your last life you would\n
not have blinked an eye at such a\n
task. Truly death has changed\n
you.\0
The Goblin Commander is a\n
despicable creature who\n
tortures and murders for fun.\n
You must kill him to gain\n
control of the fortress.\0
Regrettably, no. There are some\n
urgent matters I must attend to\n
elsewhere. I will meet you at the\n
fortress once you have killed\n
the Goblin Commander.\0
Now go, and may Marfa, Goddess of\n
Creation, protect you!\0
I hear footsteps. Someone is\n
near! Help! HELP!\0
At last my prayers have been\n
answered. Please stranger, have\n
mercy on a poor, old dwarf. Set me\n
free!\0
Wait! That sword you carry... I\n
know that sword. Where did you\n
get it? \0
Nevermind! We can discuss that\n
later. For now, just get me out of\n
these chains!\0
Who are you?
You know, it's been so long since\n
someone asked me that I think\n
I've forgotten! Why don't you\n
give me a name?\0
\k...\n
No, that won't do. I need a more\n
dramatic name.\0
\k! Yes, I will be\n
\k! It is nice to have a\n
name again! Well picked!\0
Why are you being held kept captive here?
I will free you, but first you must agree to\nhelp me.
Unfortunately, like my name, I\n
have long since forgotten the\n
reason for my incarceration.\0
A hundred years surviving off\n
nothing but rats and drips of\n
water can do terrible things to\n
a person's memory!\0
If I free you, will you promise to help me?
Release me and I swear, I will\n
assist you in whatever way I can.\0
I'm afraid I'm not much of a\n
fighter, but I'm one of the best\n
blacksmiths in all of Forceria!\n
Or at least, I used to be.\0
Free me and I will offer you my\n
services as your personal\n
blacksmith.\0
Unlock the chains and free \k!
Yes! At long last! I am free! Ha\n
ha ha! Freedom is the greatest\n
gift of all, is it not?\0
If you've been locked up for a hundred years,\nyes.
Freedom is a highly subjective concept.
Don't ask me. I've been stuck in a grave for\nyears.
Ha ha ha! You have a sense of\n
humor. That is good!\0
What do you know about the Goblin Fortress?
How do I get to the surface?
The goblins have built a\n
fortress? Since when?\0
I've obviously been down here\n
for way too long.\0
How do I get to the surface?
Now that I do know. Follow me.\0
Let's see now... a little bit to\n
the left and... yes. The secret\n
switch is still here!\0
This should take you to the\n
surface. You go on ahead and deal\n
with the goblins. I will follow\n
later.\0
If memory serves me, this area is\n
rich in the precious blue metal\n
Mithrill. Keep an eye out for it.\0
Good luck friend! May Myrii, God\n
of War, be with you.\0
Your attacks do not harm me?! It\n
must be some kind of sorcery!\0

CMI#F
Wait! Don't hurt Nobby, sir! Nobby\n
is not an enemy!\0
Ow! Get off!\0
Right, that's it, sir! I've had\n
just about enough of you! Take\n
this!\0
Nobby does not recognize you. If\n
you don't mind Nobby asking, sir,\n
who are you?\0
I am \p, a great warrior!
I will not give my name to a lowly goblin!
Give me all your treasure or I will kill you!
Begging your pardon sir, but I\n
thought great warriors could\n
kill goblins just by looking at\n
them!\0
Everybody hates Nobby.\0
Nobby doesn't have any real\n
treasure, but if sir likes, he\n
can take whatever he finds in\n
those wooden boxes over there.\0
So what does sir want from a\n
lowly goblin like Nobby?\0
Where am I?
What are you doing here?
Why are there so many creatures in this\ncemetery?
What can you tell me about the Goblin\nFortress.
Uhhh...\0
Sir is in the royal cemetery,\n
filled with tombs of the old\n
nobility. It's at the southern\n
most tip of Marmo island.\0
Nobby is the groundskeeper of\n
this cemetery. It's Nobby's job\n
to make sure everything stays in\n
tip top condition round here.\0
Sir is not from around these\n
parts? This is the black island\n
Marmo sir, resting place of\n
Kardis! Lots of evil round here\n
sir, lots!\0
Still, sir does have a point. It\n
never used to be this bad.\n
Something funny going on, if you\n
ask Nobby.\0
The main gate is to the north of\n
here. But begging your pardon\n
sir, you'll never get in that way.\n
It's too heavily guarded.\0
However Nobby knows another way\n
in. There's a passageway hidden\n
in the King's tomb in the middle\n
of the cemetery that leads to\n
the fortress.\0
By the way, Nobby found a scroll\n
lying around outside the other\n
day. Not sure what it does, but\n
it's in those wooden boxes over\n
there.\0
Nobby heard that sir killed the\n
Goblin Commander and took over\n
the fortress! Sir is a great\n
warrior after all!\0
What can Nobby do for you today,\n
sir? \0
Thank you for helping me find the secret\npassageway.
Goblins are irritating, dung-eating,\nparasites
How's the groundskeeping trade these days?
Well, got to go. Places to be. Gods to kill.
Don't mention it sir! Glad to be\n
of service!\0
No, thank YOU, sir, for not\n
killing me with your magic eyes!\n
Very kind of you sir, if I say so\n
myself!\0
But sir is the master of the\n
Goblin Fortress, is he not? So\n
what does that make sir?\0
Well, to be honest sir, Nobby\n
hasn't done much work on the\n
grounds recently. Too many\n
monsters out there for Nobby's\n
liking.\0
Not bad. But if sir doesn't\n
mind me asking, what brings\n
a great warrior back to these\n
parts?\0
See you later, sir.\0
I'm bored. I'm looking for something to do.
That is no concern of yours goblin. Good day.
Bored?! A great warrior, in\n
Nobby's home, bored to tears! We\n
can't have that, sir! No we can't!\0
How about I tell you a story sir.\n
A Marmo legend.\0
Sure, why not?
Aother time perhaps.
Does sir want to hear the legend\n
again?\0
Drop the knowledge my furry green friend.
Not right now.
So, what does sir think of\n
Nobby's story?\0
What an interesting story. Is it true?
How boring. I'm going.
Nobby does not know, sir. But\n
legend has it that the keys to\n
the dragon's prison were hidden\n
in dungeons all around Marmo.\0
If sir pleases, Nobby knows\n
where one of those dungeons is\n
supposed to be. Perhaps sir\n
would like to investigate?\0
Yes, I feel like getting my adventure on.
I haven't got time to waste chasing fairy\ntales.
Very good sir! In that case, you'd\n
better take this.\0
In the passageway sir used to\n
reach the Goblin Fortress should\n
be a door with a magic seal. Use\n
the Decoding Scroll to open it.\0
Follow the path to the coast of\n
Marmo. There you will find the\n
entrance to the secret dungeon.\n
Come back and tell Nobby what\n
you find!\0
So how was the secret chamber,\n
sir? Did you find any hidden\n
treasure? Did you? Did you? Show\n
Nobby what you found!\0
There wasn't any treasure.
I don't have it with me right now.
I found this medallion. Do you have any idea\nwhat it is?
There wasn't any treasure.
I don't have it with me right now.
That... that medallion! It... no...\n
it can't be! It's true! The legend\n
was true!\0
Arrrrgggh! My head! It hurts! I\n
feel like my brain is going to\n
burst! Help sir! Help!\0
That's strange. Is sir sure he\n
searched the chamber\n
thoroughly?\0
Well Nobby looks forward to our\n
next meeting. Please don't\n
forget to bring it with you.\0
Gibber...\0
Flee! We must flee! The dark\n
dragon Ramala will destroy us\n
all!\0
His return has been prophesized!\n
He is even more powerful than\n
Narse!\0
I can hear the wings of the dark\n
dragon Ramala beating in my\n
mind! He grows ever closer!\0
Gurgle...\0
Many years ago, before the reign\n
of emperor Beld, an evil green\n
dragon came to the shores of\n
Marmo and started rampaging.\0
Since Marmo's own dragon, Narse,\n
had fallen into a 100 year sleep,\n
there was no-one on the island\n
powerful enough to oppose the\n
dragon.\0
For ten years the dragon\n
terrorized Marmo, until finally\n
a lone warrior appeared who\n
stood against the dragon and his\n
servants.\0
After an epic battle the warrior\n
tricked the dragon, and caged\n
him inside an enchanted prison\n
for all eternity.\0
To this day, no-one knows who the\n
hero was. Some say it wasn't a\n
man at all, but a creature\n
created by the magic of the Dark\n
Elves.\0
The gate to the King's Tomb is\n
protected by a magic seal. You\n
must stand in front of the gate\n
and use a Decoding Scroll to\n
break the seal.\0
To use a Decoding Scroll place\n
it in a free slot in your Item\n
Bar, select it with D-Pad, and\n
press the Y Button.\0
To attack continuously, press\n
and hold the B Button. Now,\n
keeping the B Button held, move\n
around and use the Right Trigger\n
to attack.\0
L + analog pad: Rotate Camera.\n
R + B Buttons: Auto Attack.\n
D-Pad vertical: Select item.\n
Y Button: Use item.\0
Exchange items in your Item Bar\n
(items that can be used with the\n
Y-Button) on the Status Page.\0
Relicts of Heaven.\n
Central Marmo, desert,\n
multiporter.
As I suspected, you will not be\n
able to penetrate the fortress\n
through the main gate. You must\n
look for another way in.\0
In a house to the southwest of\n
the cemetery lives an old\n
goblin. Try questioning him.\0
He is the cemetery groundskeeper\n
and knows these parts well.\0
You cannot hurt me or anyone\n
else I name. You are just wasting\n
time.\0
Are we having fun yet?\0
Well done \p! You have\n
completed your first task\n
admirably! It seems my faith in\n
you was not misplaced.\0
You have slain the Goblin\n
Commander, and by Goblin law all\n
those who served under him must\n
now serve you.\0
Now then, it is time for me to\n
tell you more about the true\n
nature of your quest.\0
Now, I think you are ready to\n
learn some magic!\0
In the smithy across the\n
courtyard you will find three\n
large red chests. These are\n
safes for you to store your\n
possessions in.\0
Clear some space in your\n
inventory and return to me. I\n
wish to give something to you.\0
I have manifested your first\n
Book of Magic. These books are\n
how you will learn magic spells.\n
Pick it up and return to me.\0
To learn a spell you must first\n
read the book. Go to the Status\n
Page, select the Book of Magic\n
and press the A-Button to read\n
it.\0
Splendid! You have memorized the\n
spell of Recall! Now, let us see\n
if you can use it!\0
You must locate the shipwrecked\n
heroes from Lodoss. They are\n
also here to stop the\n
resurrection of Kardis and will\n
surely prove of great\n
assistance.\0
First find the knight Parn. He\n
was last seen near the Village\n
of the Dark Elves, on the\n
Northern tip of Marmo Island.\0
Exit the fortress through the\n
north gate and follow the main\n
trail north as far as it goes.\n
Try not to stray from the path!\0
It is a journey fraught with\n
danger, so be sure to use the\n
Recall spell often to return\n
here for supplies.\0
My friend, you are truly a great\n
hero. Even though the chronicles\n
of history do not record your\n
actions, I shall never forget\n
your name.\0
The final hour is upon us. The\n
moment of truth is at hand.\n
Kardis is awake. You must defeat\n
her while she is still weak!\0
You have defeated Wagnard, but\n
he was able to complete the\n
ritual. The advent of Kardis\n
draws nearer. Hurry friend!\0
The Temple of Kardis is located\n
on the 10th level of Conquera\n
Castle. You must continue your\n
descent!\0
You have breached Conquera\n
Castle! It is but a pale shadow\n
of its former glory during your\n
old reign.\0
You must face Wagnard. He is\n
waiting for you on the 2nd level.\n
Be careful, he possesses the\n
power of Kardis.\0
You must journey to Conquera\n
Castle. Take the southwest exit\n
from the desert down to the\n
ancient ruins, then head north\n
into the mountains.\0
You will find the entrance to\n
Conquera Castle in the northwest\n
of the mountain range. Remember\n
to take the key Narse gave you.\0
Return to the Village of the\n
Dark Elves and speak with\n
Marela. She will lead you to a\n
very helpful item.\0
You make a good executioner.\n
Take the heads of Ruselb and\n
Shoedle to Narse and claim your\n
reward.\0
If you are looking for more\n
magic weapons, return to the\n
Village of the Dark Elves and\n
speak with Marela.\0
Shoedle is a high priest of\n
Falaris, God of Darkness. He has\n
mastered the curse of\n
petrification. He will be a\n
tough opponent.\0
If you are looking for more\n
Ancient inscriptions, try\n
visiting some of the dungeons\n
scattered around Marmo.\0
Shoedle's power comes from a\n
statue of himself on the 4th\n
level of the Temple of Darkness.\n
You must destroy it.\0
Shoedle lives deep below the\n
ground in the Temple of\n
Darkness, dedicated to Falaris,\n
God of Darkness.\0
The Temple of Darkness is a\n
complicated maze. Check the map\n
with L + R + START and look for\n
areas you might have missed.\0
Leila can replenish your health,\n
but she is very weak. You must\n
protect her.\0
Slayn's offensive magic is\n
tremendous, but he cannot heal\n
himself. Use potions to keep\n
both of you alive.\0
You must destroy the four\n
Falaris statues located around\n
the hill of Falaris to open the\n
gate to the Temple of Darkness.\0
The Temple of Darkness is in the\n
hills to the north. Take the\n
ridge path which can be reached\n
from an exit in Narse's cave.\0
Look for the Pickaxe! It is being\n
guarded by a friendly Mithrill\n
Golem in the chamber where Narse\n
sleeps.\0
Let \k DUPLICATE the\n
PickAxe for you. You can obtain\n
much larger quantities of\n
Mithrill through digging.\0
Well done, my friend. Ruselb will\n
no longer plague Marmo. Now you\n
must seek out Slayn and Leila at\n
the cave of Narse.\0
Follow the northen trail again,\n
but go west where the road forks\n
towards the desert. Narse's cave\n
is in the rocks north of the\n
desert.\0
Parn and Deedlit are like yin\n
and yang. If one of them dies, so\n
too does the fighting spirit of\n
the other.\0
It is a pity that Parn and\n
Deedlit can no longer aid you.\n
Now you must kill Ruselb on your\n
own.\0
You must stop Ruselb! With the\n
three of you fighting together,\n
the odds are good.\0
Take the southwest exit in the\n
cave where the goblins held\n
Deedlit. It leads through the\n
underworld.\0
Parn is dead! This is terrible!\n
You were supposed to look out\n
for him. Now you must rescue\n
Deedlit on your own.\0
Take the southwest exit in the\n
cave where the goblins held\n
Deedlit. It leads through the\n
underworld.\0
I am glad to hear that Parn is\n
well. He will prove a powerful\n
ally. Help him to rescue Deedlit\n
from the goblins.\0
Be warned, while you travel with\n
Parn you are responsible for his\n
health. Use potions to cure both\n
of your wounds.\0
Parn has ventured deep into the\n
Forest of Darkness. He is\n
searching for his companion, the\n
High Elf Deedlit.\0
Deedlit is in great danger.\n
Please hurry, my friend.\0
So Parn was last seen in the\n
Forest of Darkness. I believe he\n
is looking for his companion,\n
the High Elf Deedlit.\0
If you have a sword with special\n
strength against Elves, be sure\n
to take it with you into the\n
Forest of Darkness.\0
You have found the cave of Narse.\n
Did you meet with Slayn and\n
Leila? They are also here to\n
stop Kardis.\0
You can explore that area, but I\n
think it is better if you visit\n
the Village of the Dark Elves\n
first, on the northern tip of\n
Marmo.\0
Look for Parn, the knight from\n
Lodoss. He was last seen at the\n
Village of the Dark Elves. He\n
needs your help.\0
Across the courtyard is a small\n
smithy. There you will find the\n
old dwarf \k. Talk to him\n
and then return to me for\n
further instructions.\0
\k is an exceptional\n
blacksmith. He will teach you\n
how to improve your equipment\n
with Ancient inscriptions.\0
To strengthen your magic arms\n
you must discover Ancient\n
monuments. They are scattered\n
all over Marmo.\0
If you find any Ancient\n
monuments then read them. By\n
engraving Ancients into your\n
equipment you will become much\n
more powerful.\0
The eight stone circles in the\n
courtyard link the different\n
regions of Marmo. They are\n
called teleporters.\0
If you find a teleporter during\n
your adventures, you have only\n
to step into it to activate the\n
stone circle back here.\0
If you have the strength, kill\n
the two monsters locked up in\n
the dungeon below the fortress.\n
You will receive a useful\n
weapon.\0
It appears you have understood\n
how to use the teleporters\n
outside. Good. These will save\n
you a great deal of time.\0
Oh, I completely forgot. I meant\n
to give you this Book of Magic.\0
If you read this book you will\n
learn the Recall spell.\0
The Recall Spell allows you to\n
return to the Goblin Fortress at\n
any time. Handy, is it not?\0
Hmmm, it should be somewhere\n
around the Goblin Fortress. Have\n
a look.\0
If you use the Ancient Exchange\n
book you can transfer Ancient\n
inscriptions between different\n
pieces of equipment.\0
If you loose it, you can always\n
find it in the wooden chest in\n
the corner of this room.\0
Everything in the Goblin\n
Fortress is yours now. Do with it\n
as you will.\0
Not even a scratch. Wart truly is\n
a powerful magician!\0
I see you found the equipment\n
alright. Good. Now, it's time for\n
me to teach you about the art of\n
Ancient inscriptions.\0
Ancient inscriptions are the key\n
to increasing the power of your\n
equipment. Now let us improve\n
your suit of armor.\0
You may have noticed that\n
engraving Ancient inscriptions\n
costs Mithrill. Mithrill is a\n
rare blue metal found throughout\n
Marmo.\0
Sometimes monsters will drop it,\n
sometimes you will find it in\n
boxes or chests. Collect all the\n
Mithrill you can.\0
Now, let's try transforming the\n
shape of your sword!\0
Tranforming equipment is\n
important. Different types of\n
equipment have the capacity to\n
hold different sizes of Ancient\n
inscription.\0
So now you know. Collecting\n
Mithrill and engraving Ancient\n
inscriptions is the best way to\n
improve your equipment.\0
Ha ha ha! You have been a patient\n
student. As a reward I shall\n
teach you all the Ancient\n
inscriptions I know.\0
Just to the west of this smithy I\n
have prepared an Ancient\n
monument for you. Read it and\n
then come back here.\0
You will find monuments like\n
that all over Marmo. Read them to\n
learn new Ancient inscriptions.\0
Sometimes when you engrave\n
enough of a certain Ancient\n
inscription, you will\n
automatically learn a more\n
powerful variant of that\n
inscription.\0
Here I record all the knowledge\n
of Ancient inscriptions that I\n
remember. May they aid you in\n
your quest, brave hero!\n
-\k-\0

Hope you don't mind, but I've set\n
up shop in this smithy. It feels\n
good to be working again!\0
Now before we get started, I have\n
a gift for you.\0
How did you get here?
What is this gift you speak of?
After you freed me your friend\n
Wart appeared. He told me all\n
about your quest and lead me up\n
here.\0
I don't envy you. It sounds\n
pretty risky. Gods aren't to be\n
messed with, if you ask me! But\n
I'll help you as best I can.\0
Well, I took the liberty of\n
making you some new equipment.\n
It's not my best work but it'll\n
do in a pinch.\0
I stashed it all in three\n
unlocked iron boxes in the\n
fortress dungeon you passed on\n
the way up here.\0
Go grab the equipment from the\n
iron boxes and then come back\n
and see me.\0
One more thing. You see the three\n
large chests in this room? Those\n
are safes for you to store your\n
important items.\0
So now you know the basics. Is\n
there anything else I can help\n
you with?\0
Do you want me to explain it to\n
you now? It is a little\n
complicated.\0
Yes, I wish to learn.
I already know all about it.
You can explain it to me later.
Fine, just let me know when you\n
want to learn.\0
Ha ha ha! Well feel free to ask\n
me if there's anything you might\n
have forgotten.\0
An Ancient inscription can be up\n
to 10 letters long. Different\n
pieces of equipment have\n
different Ancient size limits.\0
For example, An Ancient\n
inscription 10 letters long\n
could not be engraved onto a\n
sword with an Ancient Word limit\n
of 8 letters.\0
Are there different kinds of Ancients?
There are two types of Ancient\n
inscriptions. The first type is\n
the attribute enhancing Ancient.\n
You are already familiar with\n
these.\0
The second type of Ancient\n
inscription is the rare Ancient\n
Powers. These grant you special\n
abilities and cost no Mithrill\n
to engrave.\0
When you engrave an Ancient\n
Power to a piece of equipment it\n
is not permanent. You can swap\n
Ancient Powers whenever you come\n
here.\0
Ancient Powers are reset by\n
engraving regular Ancients, so\n
be sure to re-engrave Ancient\n
Powers at the end of a session\n
with me.\0
Oh, you brought Mithrill. Good. I\n
will keep it safe for you.\0
What can I do for you?\0
Let's go to work.
Can you make me a special sword?
Tell me more about the power of the Ancient\ninscriptions.
Time for me to get going!
Hey, don't you need some more\n
Lockpicks? You can produce more\n
Lockpicks for you very cheaply\n
through DUPLICATION.\0
Hey, if you need more PickAxe's\n
you can produce them cheaply\n
through DUPLICATION.\0
It would be my honor to create\n
for you a sword worthy of the\n
Gods themselves!\0
But to do the job right, I will\n
need 10, 000 Mithrill. It's a lot,\n
I know, but the sword will be\n
worth it.\0
I am already making you one! Fine\n
craftsmanship cannot be rushed.\n
Please be patient.\0
Yes, it is ready for you. A finer\n
blade you will not find in all of\n
Forceria!\0
Pick it up. It is on the ground\n
right next to me.\0
The oriental sword I made for\n
you is the best there is! But\n
there is a way to make it more\n
powerful.\0
Improve your DEX and CRIT\n
attributes. A higher Critical\n
Strike percentage and Critical\n
Damage multiplier is the key. \0
I see you have 10, 000 Mithrill.\n
If you like, I can make you a\n
special sword.\0
It will be a two-handed oriental\n
sword, with the blade folded\n
many hundreds of times. The\n
critical attack rate will be\n
unsurpassed.\0
Are you sure you want to spend\n
10, 000 Mithrill on such a sword?\0
No, I cannot afford that right now.
Yes, I am sure! Craft the sword!
Too rich for your blood, eh?\n
Well, I understand. But the offer\n
still stands.\0
Come back when you can spare the\n
Mithrill.\0
Very well. I will make you the\n
finest sword I can. It will take\n
a little while, so check back\n
later.\0
Heading North, boss? Well take\n
care of yourself! It's rough out\n
there!\0
You know those eight circular\n
stones on the ground over there?\n
Well I've seen them all around\n
Marmo. I wonder what they're for?\0
Sometimes I get the urge to jump\n
into the circle of light after\n
you! But I'm too scared. I don't\n
know where I'd end up!\0
I think you're a much better boss\n
than the last Lord of the\n
Fortress!\0
You scared the life out of me\n
boss! Just appearing out of\n
nowhere like that!\0
The creatures locked up in the\n
dungeon are dangerous! We'd\n
clear 'em out, but none of us are\n
strong enough to fight 'em.\0
Wow, you cleared out the\n
monsters in the dungeon! You the\n
huMAN!\0
You know that goblin who looks\n
after the cemetery? Well, he\n
gives me the creeps. Not right in\n
the head I tell you.\0
Even if you have a CRIT of 100%%\n
or more it doesn't mean you will\n
always land a critical hit. It\n
depends on the strength of the\n
enemy.\0
Hey boss, I found this red\n
crystal while I was digging.\n
I don't know what it does, but\n
you can have it if you like.\0
Hey boss, I found another red\n
crystal.\n
When you've used the last\n
crystal I gave you, I'll see if I\n
can dig out another one for you.\0
You can only have one Ancient\n
Power engraved at a time per\n
piece of equipment you wear.\n
Shame really.\0
Have you heard about the black\n
dragon Narse? He is supposed to\n
be as big as this fortress!\n
No-one's seen him in a long\n
time though.\0
Boss! Shall I rally the troops?\0
Yes, I want to have a meeting!
No. Carry on as you were.
Can do boss!\0
Goblins! Gather round! The boss\n
wants to speak!\0
Alright boss, all present and\n
correct. What are your orders?\0
I want all of you to drop dead!
Spread out! Search for treasure!
I need volunteers to fight with me!
What's a volunteer?\0
I'm too busy!\0
I'm too old!\0
I'm too young!\0
Got to look after the wife and\n
kids!\0
I'm too cowardly!\0
You heard the boss! Spread out!\n
Look for treasure!\0
They'll just be a second, boss.\0
Alright Goblins, report in! What\n
did you find?\0
That's your lot, boss.\0
Ok Goblins. Dismissed!\0
Not a thing.\0
I got lost.\0
I found some Mithrill!\0
My feet hurt!\0
I went to the toilet!\0
I'm tired\0
Can I go home now?\0
I wasn't looking.\0
I found... nothing!\0
I found some treasure!\0
Now there's something you don't\n
see everyday. Boss, why are you\n
laughing?\0
What are we? 
What does it spell? GOBLINS!\0
Damn, you found me! I didn't do\n
it, nobody saw me, you can't prove\n
anything! Ha! \0

Hello boss! I'm on watch duty for\n
Wart. No-one but you is to pass\n
through this door!\0
If you find a rare piece of\n
equipment it is displayed in the\n
glass cases inside the smithy.\0
If you ever get lost then take a\n
look at the main map by pressing\n
the L Trigger, R Trigger and\n
START all at once.\0
That's what I'm looking for. Any\n
type will do. I will give you\n
good Mithrill for it.\0
Let's trade.
Not right now.
Sorry, Boss. You don't have what I\n
want. No item, no Mithrill.\0
Thanks, boss!\0
Hell Talisman.
Pierce of ear.
Leather boots.
Rabbit buckle.
Wizard Ring.
Magic Resist Coat.
Prevent Ring.
Thanks, Boss. You've cleared me\n
out for now. But I hear that the\n
black dragon Narse owns some\n
incredible items.\0

How long are you going to stand\n
there Wart? I can't work with you\n
looking over my shoulder like\n
that! What do you want?\0
I just wanted to thank you,\n
\k! You are doing a fine\n
job. I am very grateful for your\n
help.\0
Don't mention it. It is my honor\n
to aid one of the six legendary\n
heros that saved Lodoss.\0
But you've been hanging around\n
the smithy a lot recently. Tell\n
me, what is your concern?\0
There is so much equipment on\n
Marmo, but there is not enough\n
Mithrill to engrave sufficient\n
Ancient inscriptions into all of\n
it.\0
But as I explained before, you do\n
not have to. When you TRANSFORM\n
equipment all the engraved\n
Ancients are transferred to the\n
new form.\0
Yes, it is better to concentrate\n
all Ancient engravings on one\n
piece of equipment, and then\n
TRANSFORM that piece into\n
another form.\0
Exactly. The only problem is,\n
\p must return here each\n
time he wants to TRANSFORM his\n
equipment. There is nothing to\n
be done about that.\0
Perhaps there is. While I have\n
been watching you work I have\n
learnt a little of the art of\n
magic arms. I believe I have a\n
solution.\0
What? Preposterous! This trade\n
takes years to master! There is\n
no way you could have solved\n
such a problem just by watching\n
me work!\0
If you say so. But please, take a\n
look at this magic book I\n
created.\0
Hmmm. What's this? A book that\n
allows you to transfer Ancients\n
between different pieces of\n
equipment at will! Ingenious!\0
Thank you. Can you give this to\n
\p, and please explain its\n
function clearly.\0
I will do no such thing! The man\n
has had enough lessons! He is\n
smart enough to figure out how\n
to use the book on his own.\0
Ha ha ha! You mean you are tired\n
enough of teaching? Very well.\n
I'm sure he will understand how\n
to use the book.\0
Now \p can carry multiple\n
weapons and transfer all the\n
Ancient inscriptions between\n
them at will!\0
Yes. And I can DUPLICATE all\n
weapons that he has found, so he\n
will always have the right\n
weapon for the right enemy.\0
Splendid! Now I must return to my\n
studies. Until our next meeting\n
dwarf.\0
Until next time old man.\0

*CTJ
How can I assist you?\0
Tell me about Ruselb.
Tell me about Pirotess.
Why did you not leave with the other\nvillagers? 
Do you know where I can find a knight called\nParn?
Tell me about Ruselb.
Tell me about Pirotess.
Why did you not leave with the other\nvillagers?
I must kill Ruselb!
\p, tell me. What has\n
happened to Ruselb?\0
His has been terminated.
One more thing. Whilst I was\n
captive I overheard the guards\n
talking about treasure hidden on\n
the third floor of the pyramid.\0
The guards also mentioned that\n
the treasure was guarded by\n
demons. Remember, certain demons\n
are vulnerable to fire.\0
Oh dear.\0
Parn? Sorry, I do not know him.\n
However, I did hear that a human\n
knight was spotted yesterday in\n
the Forest of Darkness.\0
He has probably moved on by now,\n
but it might be a good place to\n
pick up the trail.\0
How do I get to the Forest of Darkness?
Take the east exit on the ground\n
floor of the pyramid. It leads to\n
a glade north of here, which\n
connects to the Forest of\n
Darkness.\0
Ruselb is the leader of the Dark\n
Elves. He has been seduced by the\n
promise of power from Wagnard.\0
Who is Wagnard?
Wagnard is the high priest of\n
Kardis. I believe he is the one\n
trying to resurrect the Goddess\n
of Destruction.\0
Pirotess is a Dark Elf, but she\n
is loyal to the human general,\n
Ashram. She won't admit it, but\n
she's in love with him.\0
Ashram's dream of ruling a\n
united Lodoss ended with his\n
defeat at Fire Dragon Mountain.\n
He is organizing a mass\n
evacuation of his forces.\0
I am too old, I do not care to\n
leave my home now. I will perish\n
with Marmo. But you should get\n
off this island as quickly as\n
possible.\0
It is my mission to stop Kardis. I will not\nflee.
Ha ha ha! That is very brave of\n
you. Stupid, but brave. I admire\n
your courage. You remind me of\n
Beld.\0
Who is Beld? He was part of the\n
legendary group of six that\n
defeated a powerful Demon King\n
on Lodoss many years ago.\0
After the Demon King was slain,\n
Beld came to Marmo and ruled\n
here as Emperor for many years.\n
He is dead now.\0
Oh! I know he had chosen a dark\n
path but he was still my\n
Grandchild, and I cared for him\n
deeply.\0
I am sorry that it had to end\n
this way for him. My heart is\n
heavy with grief.\0
\p, tell me, how did Ruselb\n
die? Did he fall in battle?\0
He died a warrior's death, fighting for what\nhe believed in.
He died a sniveling coward, begging for his\nlife.
Thank you. It is kind of you to\n
say so. At least I know my\n
grandchild died a warrior's\n
death. But still...\0
Oh! That is awful! Poor Ruselb! I\n
know he was not a good person,\n
but still, I wish there was\n
something I could have done.\0
\p, have you heard of the\n
30 sacred medallions of Marmo?\n
They are supposed to contain\n
powerful spiritual properties.\0
Legend has it they can redeem\n
the souls of the damned. I wish\n
to have mercy on my grandchild\n
and allow him to rest in peace.\0
If you could collect all 30\n
medallions, I could use them to\n
redeem my grandson's soul and\n
set his spirit free.\0
\p, I know it is a lot to\n
ask, but will you do this for me?\0
Tell me more about these medallions.
Yes, Marela. I will help you.
The medallions are hidden in\n
secret caves and dungeons\n
located all over the island. You\n
can see them on your map as you\n
travel.\0
Most of the dungeon entrances\n
are blocked by a magic seal. You\n
must use a decoding scroll to\n
get inside.\0
However, if you agree to help me,\n
I will show you where you can\n
find a Decoding Book, which will\n
open all seals without fading.\0
I shall help you Marela.
Thank you, \p! Thank you!\n
Pirotess was right about you.\n
You do credit to your\n
reputation.\0

Portal of transience, manifest!\n
Bend time and space for the hero\n
who seeks the 30 sacred\n
medallions!\0
This teleporter will take you\n
directly to the entrance of a\n
dungeon which contains the\n
Decoding Book.\0
Now, do not think that I will not\n
reward you for your services.\n
Over the years I have amassed\n
quite a collection of rare\n
treasures.\0
Bring me all the medallions that\n
you find, and I shall show my\n
gratitude by giving you these\n
treasures.\0
The more medallions you bring,\n
the more treasures I will give.\n
Happy hunting!\0
Ah, I see you have brought me a\n
present. Lets see now, how many\n
medallions do you have?\0
\c0xc
Oh, the final medallion! I have\n
been waiting for this for a long\n
time! Quickly, give it to me.\0
Alright, here you go.
No, I will not give it you.
Something is suspicious here.
At last! I have all the\n
medallions! The key is\n
assembled!\0
You fool, your greed shall be\n
your undoing! You were so\n
focused on my treasure that you\n
have ended your own life!\0
What are you talking about?
Let me tell you murderer!\0
What a pity. The last treasure is\n
by far the best. A weapon of\n
unimaginable power. You would be\n
unstoppable.\0
Very well, return when you have\n
changed your mind.\0
Nothing is suspicious. I am\n
anxious to redeem the soul of my\n
Grandchild, Ruselb. That is all.\0
Have mercy on an old woman, who's\n
days are numbered. Give me the\n
medallion.\0
Finally, you have all the\n
medallions. Quickly, give them\n
to me!\0
I will give you 29 of them.
I will give you them all.
Why? Very well, then I shall give\n
you treasures for 29 medallions.\0
But the treasure I prepared for\n
the last medallion is by far the\n
most valuable of all.\0
Of course, you found the\n
medallions, and they are yours\n
to do with as you wish. Please\n
return if you change your mind.\0
You have brought me a total of 29\n
medallions.\0
There is only one medallion\n
left. Find it and I shall give\n
you my last treasure. I promise,\n
you will not be dissapointed.\0
You have now brought me a total\n
of 28 medallions.\0
You have now brought me a total\n
of 27 medallions.\0
You have now brought me a total\n
of 26 medallions.\0
You have now brought me a total\n

medallion so far.\0
I long for the day when I can\n
redeem my grandson's soul.\n
Please bring me the medallions\n
so that I may pray for him.\0
There is only one medallion\n
left. Find it and I shall give\n
you my last treasure. I promise,\n
you will not be dissapointed.\0
You spared my life but...\0
... I shall not thank you. Curse\n
you for killing my grandson. My\n
only wish if for you to join him\n
in the Realm of the Dead.\0
I not expect you to understand\n
how I feel. Leave me alone\n
murderer.\0
...\0
I... I... am coming Ruselb....\0
To thank you, I shall give you my\n
treasures.\0
Claim your reward on the pyramid\n
terrace and accept my gratitude.\0
\sIn Less Than An\n
From Here Will\n
Join Others From\0
Bring me one more medallion and\n
I will give you the next\n
treasure.\0
Bring me another 2 medallions\n
and I will give you the next\n
treasure.\0
Bring me another 3 medallions\n
and I will give you the next\n
treasure.\0
Bring me another 4 medallions\n
and I will give you the next\n
treasure.\0
Thank you for getting me out of\n
there. I am Marela, the elder of\n
this village.\0
Ruselb imprisoned me because I\n
opposed his decision to\n
sacrifice our villagers to\n
Kardis.\0
Ruselb has been acting really\n
strange recently. He has this\n
look in his eyes like he is\n
possessed.\0
Perhaps. Who knows what Wagnard\n
is capable of? But that does not\n
excuse his actions.\0
His treachery is unforgivable.\0
I agree.\0
Pirotess! It was just as you\n
said, Ruselb has decided to\n
serve Wagnard. He aids in the\n
resurrection of Kardis!\0
Marela, leave it be. It is over\n
now. I do not wish to anger\n
Ruselb. Let us prepare for the\n
final evacuation of the village.\0
Yes, that is best. You and Ashram\n
must get the people of Marmo to\n
saftey. There is not much time\n
left.\0
Trust me. By the time Kardis\n
awakens we will be long gone.\0
\p, I am grateful to you\n
for your assistance. Right now, I\n
must help these villagers get to\n
the boats. \0
But when I have finished, I will\n
return to give you your reward. I\n
am a woman of honor and I always\n
repay my debts.\0
Try to stay alive till then!\0
A human! You look strangely\n
familiar... Do I know you? What\n
are you doing here?\0
What is it, \p? What do\n
you want now?\0
If you have problems, perhaps I could help?
My name is \p. I do not know you.
Do you know of the knight Parn. I am looking\nfor him.
Why is this village so empty?
It sounds like you have problems. Perhaps I\ncould help?
That is strange. Your voice\n
sounds so familiar. I feel like\n
we have met before...\0
At any rate, well met. My name is\n
Pirotess. I am a Dark Elf, and\n
follow the black commander\n
Ashram.\0
Ah, so you also seek that\n
murdering scum. He has killed\n
many of my troops before. It\n
seems our destinies are\n
intwined.\0
I would love to help you hunt him\n
down, but unfortunately I have\n
more pressing matters. If I hear\n
anything, I will let you know.\0
So you noticed. Most of the\n
villagers have already\n
evacuated. Those that remain\n
fear for their lives.\0
Ruselb, our leader, has begun\n
sacrificing innocent villagers\n
to Kardis. It is part of his deal\n
with Wagnard.\0
I do not need your help.\0
Well, there is one matter that I\n
need to resolve. For reasons of\n
diplomacy, I cannot actively\n
involve myself. \0
But know this human, the task is\n
a dangerous one. Do you still\n
wish to help me?\0
It would be my pleasure.
Let me think about it.
Very well. Stay a moment while I\n
open the entrance to the lower\n
level of the pyramid.\0
Before I entrust you with my\n
task, you must first prove\n
yourself worthy.\0
Enter the pyramid and kill the\n
blue Winged Demon within. Then\n
meet me at the base of the\n
pyramid stairs.\0
Tsh. Typical human. All talk, no\n
action.\0
It appears you are a capable\n
warrior after all, \p. You\n
have proven yourself worthy of\n
my trust.\0
But I must warn you, even for a\n
warrior such as yourself this is\n
a dangerous mission. Are you\n
sure you wish to help me?\0
I am ready Pirotess.
Wait, there is something I must do first.
Very well. I will wait for you\n
here. Please hurry.\0
The village elder, Marela, is\n
being held captive in a room on\n
the first floor of this pyramid.\n
I need you to save her.\0
If you are caught I will deny any\n
involvement. Pass through this\n
door behind me and head up the\n
stairs.\0
By the way, I have news of our\n
enemy, Parn. Spies tell me he was\n
spotted in the Forest of\n
Darkness, north of here.\0
We shall meet again once you\n
have saved Marela! Good luck!\0
Leave Marela with me. She will be\n
punished for her crimes, but she\n
will not be killed.\0
You don't seem to know what you\n
want either.\0
Damn Ruselb! Why is he acting\n
like this?!\0
It must have something to do\n
with that sorcerer Wagnard!\0
What am I to do? I want to help\n
Marela but I cannot oppose\n
Ruselb! Not now!\0
Halt! Who goes there?\0
Halt human! What are you doing\n
here? Answer my questions or you\n
will pay with your life!\0
You're back again! I will give\n
you one more chance.\0
Who are you?\0
My name is \p. I am a great warrior.
I don't take orders from Dark Elves!
Lower your weapons. I come in peace.
A great warrior indeed! You\n
humans are so arrogant you make\n
me sick! You look more like a\n
barbarian to me.\0
For that arrogance I shall see\n
you dead!\0
Guards, attack!\0
And if you do not answer my\n
questions you will go in pieces! \0
Tell me, barbarian, what brings\n
you to our village?\0
I am just passing through and need a nights\nshelter.
I am looking for a knight called Parn.
I am on my way to slay the Goddess Kardis.
The inn is closed barbarian!\n
Most villagers have already fled\n
the island, and you would be wise\n
to do the same.\0
Consider yourself warned!\0
Parn?! Why are you looking for\n
him? Answer me!\0
I'm sorry did I say Parn. I meant Kahn! Yes\nKahn! My mistake.
Parn is my mortal enemy. I wish to track him\ndown and kill him.
The wizard Wart sent me to find him. I wish to\nhelp him.
You?! A mortal barbarian kill a\n
Goddess?! Ha ha ha ha! That is the\n
funniest thing I've heard in\n
years!\0
Listen to me fool. Most\n
villagers have already fled the\n
island, and you would be wise to\n
do the same.\0
I am not mistaken. You clearly\n
said Parn. What business have\n
you with the knight?\0
So you wish to kill Parn? Then it\n
appears we share a common enemy.\0
Our orders are to search for\n
Parn and the other heroes from\n
Lodoss. If you find them, be sure\n
to let us know.\0
Parn is a sworn enemy of the Dark\n
Elves. You have come to the wrong\n
place barbarian! Prepare to die!\0
I demand to know the meaning of\n
this outrage!\0
To what do you refer?\0
You know damn well what I'm\n
talking about. Why has the\n
village elder been taken\n
captive?\0
It is by order of Ruselb, leader\n
of the Dark Elves. It is out of\n
my control.\0
But we are supposed to be\n
evacuating! Kardis is coming!\n
All villagers must leave the\n
island immediately!\0
I do not question my orders!\n
Ruselb said the village elder is\n
to remain incarcerated in the\n
pyramid! Now stand down!\0
But she did nothing wrong!\n
Ruselb is out of control. He is\n
acting crazy.\0
Perhaps, but Ruselb is still our\n
leader and he will show no mercy\n
towards those who disobey his\n
orders.\0
I know. I do not wish to\n
challenge Ruselb either, but\n
something must be done...\0
\sHirake Goma\n
Open The Sesame\0
There is an abandoned house in\n
the corner of the village that\n
is haunted. People say they saw a\n
ghost in there.\0
Ruselb is the leader of the Dark\n
Elves on Marmo. He has been\n
acting strange ever since he\n
allied with Wagnard.\0
I saw a human in the Forest of\n
Darkness. A young knight. He was\n
calling for someone named...\n
Deedlit
Ever since the news that Wagnard\n
intends to resurrect Kardis, the\n
Dark Elves have been evacuating\n
Marmo.\0
Because our village elder,\n
Marela, challenged Ruselb, he\n
imprisoned her in the pyramid.\0
The entrance to the pyramid is\n
blocked by magic stones. These\n
stones can only be moved by a\n
powerful Dark Elf.\0
I must leave now. See you later,\n
\p!\0
Leave Marela with me. She will be\n
punished, but I will see that she\n
is not killed.\0
\c0xc

A >F
?333?
I presume you are the human that\n
freed the village elder? Ruselb\n
said you might be coming. You\n
have traveled a long way to die\n
alone!\0
Who says he's alone?\0
Hmmm. Let's see. A whole demon\n
posse versus a single man. That\n
hardly seems fair now, does it?\0
Parn! How nice of you to join us!\n
Ruselb will be pleased when I\n
inform him I have disposed of\n
you both.\0
Even together you are no match\n
for my powers.\0
Salamander, in the name of the\n
Goddess of Darkness, Falaris, I\n
summon thee!\0
Paint the walls with their\n
blood!\0
That was quite a battle! You\n
fight with great skill stranger.\n
You didn't really need my help at\n
all!\0
Still, I was glad to lend my\n
sword nonetheless. Allow me to\n
introduce myself. My name is\n
Parn. \0
Parn! I have been searching for you!
You have? Do I know you? Your\n
voice sounds... familiar.\0
I am \p. Wart sent me to help you.
The great Wart! Well why didn't\n
you say so? Any friend of Wart's\n
is a friend of mine! Well met,\n
\p.\0
Wart is correct. I could use some\n
help right now. My companion,\n
Deedlit, is being held prisoner\n
in the catacombs below us.\0
I will help you rescue Deedlit.
I will help you, if in return you will help me\ndestroy Ruselb.
I thank you. Somehow Ruselb\n
managed to capture her, and has\n
handed her over to his goblin\n
servants to guard.\0
Goblins are not known for their\n
kindness towards prisoners. I\n
fear for her saftey.\0
Ruselb?! I have no love for\n
Ruselb, but he is the leader of\n
the loathsome Dark Elves and\n
commands a powerful force.\0
It will not be an easy battle,\n
but if you help me rescue\n
Deedlit, I will help you fight\n
against Ruselb.\0
Now let us hurry! Deedlit is in\n
danger. There is no time to\n
waste!\0
Follow me then, young knight!
Good, then let us join forces, partner!
Young
 knight? I believe I am\n
older than you are, child! Though\n
I will admit, your skill\n
suggests many more years.\0
Heh heh heh! Partner it is! Let's\n
go!\0
L>H_
I do not know you stranger, but\n
you have become quite the thorn\n
in Wagnard's side. Do not think\n
that you will leave my forest\n
alive.\0
Parn, the 
Freedom Knight
. I have\n
been waiting for you. I knew you\n
would come to save your precious\n
High Elf.\0
Ruselb, you bastard! How could\n
you burn the forest?! How could\n
you allow such wanton\n
destruction?\0
Ha ha ha! You are spirited, Elf.\n
That is good! I will take great\n
pleasure in breaking that spirit\n
before I finally kill you.\0
Shut up Ruselb! You are insane!\n
We know you are helping Wagnard\n
to resurrect Kardis. We won't let\n
that happen!\0
You are well informed. Yes\n
Kardis will rise soon enough.\n
But I wouldn't worry, none of you\n
will live long enough to see it.\0
Enough talk! Taste steel Dark Elf!
I will prevent the resurrection of Kardis.
What do you hope to gain from the rise of\nKardis?
And what makes you think you\n
aren't already too late, human?\n
Kardis stirs and no mortal can\n
slay a God.\0
A new era of destruction\n
approaches. Those who serve\n
Kardis will rule absolutely.\n
Those who oppose her will be\n
crushed.\0
Wagnard has promised me power\n
beyond imagination. For my part,\n
I will rule Marmo once Kardis\n
has returned.\0
I think it is time for you to\n
experience the power of Kardis\n
first hand.\0
Prepare yourselves!\0
Ha ha ha! Is that the best you\n
can do?\0
Give up and I swear I will make\n
your deaths quick!\0
Pathetic creature, lie down and\n
die!\0
It appears I must now fight you\n
myself! So be it. If you want a\n
job done right, do it yourself...\0
When you get to Hell, tell them\n
Ruselb sent you! \0
Let's leave. We must consider our\n
next steps.\0
Let's get out of here. It breaks\n
my heart to watch the forest\n
burn...\0
We are safe here. That was some\n
battle. I am glad to see the end\n
of Ruselb. He got what he\n
deserved.\0
Parn, don't pretend you won the\n
battle single handed! I fought\n
as hard as you did.\0
I know, Deed. You fought like a\n
tiger. You were an honor to your\n
race.\0
But in truth the real champion\n
here is \p. He has saved\n
both our lives today.\0
Indeed you speak the truth.\n
Thank you, \p. We are once\n
again in your debt.\0
It is I who should be thanking you.
A woman should know other ways of showing\nher gratitude.
Your modesty becomes you,\n
\p. Your chivalry is rare.\n
You are truly a gallant warrior.\0
I hope you do not ask of me what\n
I think you ask?! I am not kind\n
of Elf!\0
Parn, are you going to let him\n
talk to me like that?\0
Deedlit, he was only joking.\n
Can't you tell?\0
Anwyay, what shall we do now?
We must decide upon our next\n
steps. If Ruselb was telling the\n
truth, we may already be too late\n
to stop Wagnard. What do you\n
think Deedlit?\0
I fear he spoke the truth.\n
Wagnard has all the treasures\n
that he needs, and may have\n
already completed the ritual.\0
Tell me more about Wagnard.
Where can I find Wagnard?
If Kardis is awake then we must kill her.
Wagnard is a high priest of\n
Kardis. He used to serve Beld and\n
Ashram, though in truth he was\n
only serving himself.\0
Is he more powerful than Wart?
Perhaps in his youth, but not\n
now. There is only one person I\n
know whose power can be compared\n
to Wart: the Grey Witch Karla.\0
Who is this Grey Witch?
Karla is a powerful sorceress.\n
She has lived for hundreds of\n
years by possessing many\n
different people.\0
She claims she strives to keep\n
the balance of good and evil on\n
Lodoss. I believe she is\n
involved in all this somehow.\0
Tell me more about Wagnard.
Where can we find Wagnard?
If Kardis is awake then we must kill her.
Legend has it that a castle was\n
built on top of the temple of\n
Kardis, the final resting place\n
of the Goddess of Destruction.\0
We believe this was Conquera\n
Castle. If that's where the\n
temple of Kardis is, that is\n
where we will find Wagnard.\0
Tell me more about Wagnard.
If Kardis is awake then we must kill her.
I hate to be the one to break\n
this to you, but mortals cannot\n
kill Gods.\0
No matter. I must try. It is my destiny.
Is it your destiny to die? To\n
challenge a Goddess, even when\n
they are at their weakest, would\n
be madness!\0
I admire your courage \p,\n
but Deedlit is right. To fight\n
Kardis in her temple would mean\n
certain death, or worse.\0
There is no bravery in suicide.\n
We must find another way.\0
Then our paths must seperate here.
But I need your help!
I wish you luck, but I am afraid\n
we cannot accompany you any\n
further.\0
I am sorry, \p. Even though\n
you have helped us so much today,\n
we cannot accompany you any\n
further.\0
Parn! We must return home and\n
make preperations. If Kardis\n
heads towards Lodoss we must be\n
ready.\0
Yes, our responsibility is to\n
the people of Lodoss first.\0
I am sorry, \p, but we must\n
return to Lodoss now.\0
It is alright. Go now, and protect your\npeople.
You are nothing but common cowards.
I am glad you understand. Brave\n
warrior it has been an honor to\n
fight with you! May the light of\n
Falis guide you on your quest!\0
\p... I am sorry you feel\n
that way. I hope someday you will\n
understand.\0
Time to go. Deedlit, do your\n
thing!\0
Ready?\0
Master of wind, grant me your\n
power! Lift our bodies into the\n
air!\0
Ready your steel! The enemy\n
approaches!\0
Finally we can leave this\n
dreadful place. I will be glad to\n
see sunlight again.\0
We fight well as a team. Perhaps\n
we can defeat Ruselb after all,\n
right Deedlit? Deedlit? Deedlit,\n
what's wrong?\0
... something is amiss. I sense a\n
disturbance in nature. Do you\n
feel it?\0
Don't talk nonsense, Elf
No, what do you feel?
Curb your tongue! Deedlit has a\n
gift for sensing such things.\n
What is it, Deedlit?\0
The spirits of the forest cry\n
out in pain. The earth is in\n
turmoil. Something terrible has\n
happened.\0
Is it Ruselb?\0
Yes, Ruselb is behind this.\n
Somehow he is... hurting the\n
forest. We must hurry.\0
333?
>fff?333?
fff?
?fff?
?fff?b
We should be able to leave the\n
underworld now.\0
Let us head to the surface and\n
find Ruselb. I have had enough of\n
this place.\0
Is there no end to this maze! I\n
feel like we've been running\n
around in circles.\0
Have faith, Deedlit. We will find\n
a way out of here.\0
I wonder where Slayn and Leila\n
are? I hope they are well.\0
This chasm seems bottomless! I\n
have never seen such a place\n
before!\0
You go first! Let's find a way\n
through this underworld\n
quickly.\0
Parn! Watch my back!\0
\p, you could use a potion\n
to heal us. After all, you are our\n
leader!\0
I grow weary of this accursed\n
place. Let us hurry to the\n
surface!\0
I don't know who you are but I am\n
very grateful for your help.\0
I...\0
I am sorry, but I can fight no\n
more...\0
Follow the sparking trail and\n
defeat the gatekeeper to open\n
the doorway to the world above\0

Parn! Over here! Help!\0
Quickly! We must save Deedlit!\0
Deedlit! Hang on! Damn these\n
goblins, there is no end to them!\0
Stranger, I am alright for now!\n
Aid Parn! Defeat the goblins!\0
... Thank you. I am safe.\0
Parn! I knew you'd come!\0
Deedlit! Thank the Gods! Are you\n
alright?\0
Yes I'm fine. Stranger, thank you!\n
I am in your debt!\0
How could goblins capture a High Elf?
Goblins? Pah. It wasn't the\n
goblins! I could handle an army\n
of goblins. No, it was Ruselb!\0
But where are my manners. I did\n
not even ask you your name, brave\n
knight.\0
My name is \p. Wart sent me to aid\nParn.
The great wise Wart? Strange\n
that he should concern himself\n
in the matters of Marmo.\0
Why did you and Parn come to Marmo?
We must find Ruselb. Where is he now?
I must stop Ruselb. Will you help me?
Deedlit, let me explain.\0
Our spies informed us that\n
Wagnard is attempting to\n
resurrect the Goddess of\n
Destruction, Kardis, here on\n
Marmo.\0
Deedlit, myself and several\n
others set sail from Lodoss to\n
stop him. But just off the coast\n
of Marmo we encountered a fierce\n
storm.\0
During the storm we were forced\n
to abandon ship and we were all\n
seperated. Shortly afterwards I\n
was captured.\0
If we pass through the\n
underworld we should reach\n
Ruselb's hideout. There is an\n
exit at the southwest corner of\n
this cave.\0
You want to do what? Ruselb is\n
the leader of the Dark Elves. To\n
face him with just the three of\n
us would be difficult.\0
Deedlit, wait. I promised\n
\p that I would help him\n
fight Ruselb, and I cannot go\n
back on my word.\0
Parn, that is so typical of you!\n
Thinking with your sword and not\n
your head.\0
Very well. I shall accompany the\n
two of you and fight as best I\n
can. I owe you that much.\0
You might be right there.\0
We have to stop Ruselb. He is in league with\nWagnard.
If you will not help me, I will go alone.
\p is right. Ruselb must\n
be stopped. I will lend my sword.\n
Deedlit, what do you say?\0
No! Wait! You helped me save\n
Deedlit and I must repay that\n
debt. I will fight by your side,\n
no matter what the outcome.\0
If we pass through the\n
underworld we should reach\n
Ruselb's hideout. There is an\n
exit at the southwest corner of\n
this cave.\0
The doorway is open. This path\n
will take us to Ruselb's hideout.\0
You should be able to enter the\n
underworld over there.\0
333?
Little people want to leave\n
underworld! Little people want\n
Dane to open gate?\0
Little people must defeat Dane\n
and his friends first!\0
Little people strong... Dane open\n
gate... \0

Narse fell in battle to a mighty\n
warrior. Despite his age, he put\n
up quite a fight.\0
This was the best death that he\n
could have hoped for. You have\n
proved yourself a worthy\n
guardian of his honor.\0
At least his soul will be free.\n
Good luck on your quest hero. May\n
Marfa protect you.\0

Now guardian, my final wish. Let\n

I cannot help you in this fight.\n

I will pray to Marfa for your\n
victory.\0

I am old and tired and wish to\n
leave this world. But honor\n
requires that I fight as best I\n
can. Good luck, guardian.
I thought you wanted to fulfill\n
your destiny at any price. I was\n
wrong.\0
To obtain the Dragon coat of\n
arms I will have to deceive\n
Narse.\0
I admire your strength, but my\n
admiration is quickly turning\n
into contempt.\0
If it weren't for the order by\n
Wart I would join you, friend.\0
Farewell then. I do not think\n
that we will meet again.\0
You damaged the honor of an\n
ancient dragon. You do not know\n
the severity of such an offence.\0
Now that you have avenged the\n
honor of Narse, he will be able\n
to rest in peace.\0
Wait, Narse awakes! He wishes to\n
speak to you hero.\0

Once an ancient Dragon looses\n
his temper, the only thing to do\n
is run.\0
Be careful you do not anger\n
Narse.\0
Slayn will help you to\n
communicate with Narse. Speak\n
with him.\0
I will help you as best I can.\n
You must return to the Temple of\n
Darkness and kill Shoedle.\0
Narse is asleep. I recommend\n
going first to the Forest of\n
Darkness, and then to the Temple\n
of Darkness.\0
Narse is asleep. If you wish to\n
reach the Temple of Darkness,\n
take the north exit from the\n
lower level of this cave.\0
Ruselb is in the Forest of\n
Darkness. Follow the trail north\n
from the Goblin Fortress as far\n
as it goes.\0
Examine the area surrounding the\n
entrance to the Temple of\n
Darkness in the hills of\n
Falaris. There is a hidden\n
passageway.\0
Give the heads of Ruselb and\n
Shoedle to Narse.\0
If you wish to enter Conquera\n
Castle you must take the skull\n
statue key with you. I will pray\n
to Marfa for your victory.\0
I am protected by Wart's magic.\n
Do not waste your time.\0
Act your age!\0
What are you doing? If you anger\n
Narse you will not live to tell\n
the tale!\0
Narse appears to be in a deep\n
sleep. You are lucky. Do not try\n
that again.\0
Now you've done it! Now you've\n
done it!\0
Narse awakes! Quick Leila, let's\n
get out of here! Hero, I would\n
leave as well if I were you!\0
Someone approaches! Who are you?\n
What are you doing here? Don't\n
come any closer!\0
Leila, please! This could be who\n
we are waiting for.\0
Stranger, I am Slayn and this is\n
my wife, Leila. We have journeyed\n
to Marmo with a small group from\n
Lodoss on a mission of upmost\n
importance.\0
We are here to prevent the\n
resurrection of the Goddess of\n
Destruction, Kardis. I myself am\n
a servant of the Goddess of\n
Creation, Marfa.\0
I apologize for how I reacted to\n
you just now. I do not feel\n
comfortable on this island. It\n
is a frightening place.\0
I do not know who you are,\n
stranger, but we do not wish to\n
fight. Now, please, lower your\n
weapon.\0
Get out of my way and you won't get hurt.
The last time I lowered my sword to a wizard\nI was attacked.
What are you doing in this cave?
My name is \p. Wart sent me here to\nmeet you.

I must admit, if I met a wizard\n
in such a place, I would also be\n
suspicious. But we mean you no\n
harm.\0
I swear by the Goddess Marfa\n
that my husband speaks the\n
truth.\0
We are here on a mission. Since\n
our party was split up, we have\n
been traveling on our own.\0
Slayn managed to find me, but we\n
have heard no news of our other\n
companions, Parn and Deedlit.\0
They are both strong warriors\n
who can take care of themselves.\n
But I worry, nonetheless.\0
We came to this cave to meet with\n
someone at the request of an old\n
friend of ours.\0
Wart! So it is you we have been\n
waiting for.\0
I suspected as much. Slayn, look\n
at his hair.\0
Ah. I see now. Wart approached us\n
a little while ago. He wanted us\n
to wait in Narse's cave for a\n
warrior with red hair.\0
Wart said that you would need to\n
use Slayn to communicate with\n
the black dragon Narse.\0
I presume that you have some\n
business with the dragon. Would\n
you like to be introduced now?\0
Why do I need an interpreter to talk to\nNarse? 
How powerful is Narse? Could I defeat him?
Please, take me to Narse.
How powerful is Narse? Could I defeat him?
Please take me to Narse.
Why do I need an interpreter to talk to\nNarse?
Please take me to Narse.
Please take me to Narse.
Narse is one of the five ancient\n
dragons. He has existed since\n
antiquity and only speaks the\n
forgotten language of Dragon.\0
Slayn is a learned scholar. He is\n
one of the few men alive who can\n
fluently speak the ancient\n
language.\0
What? Surely you do not wish to\n
fight the dragon? That would be\n
suicide!\0
Leila is right. The powers of an\n
ancient dragon are second only\n
to the Gods themselves. It would\n
be foolish to challenge him.\0
Alright.\0
Come with us. Stay close.\0
I shall now awaken Narse. I do\n
not know how he will react to our\n
presence. Are you ready for your\n
destiny, warrior?\0
I am ready. Wake the dragon.
Please, wait a little.
Very well. But time presses on.\n
Do not delay too long.\0
Ok, here we go.\0
Great black dragon Narse, you\n
have visitors! Awake! Grant us an\n
audience, we beseech thee.\n
 \sDark Narse Awake To Talk\n
With Us\0
\sWhats Up Guys\n
Im Very Hungry\n
Could Thee Be\n
My Dinner Huh\0
Who disturbs my slumber? I see\n
three humans before me. Mortals,\n
why have you woken me?
I wish to destroy Kardis, Goddess of\nDestruction.
I wish to fight you dragon.
\sHeh Heh Lol\n
All Right Babe\n
Fuck Your Ass\0
Then you wish to die. I will not\n
accept your challenge fool.
\sI Should Go Any\n
Where U Must Do\n
Kill Fuckin Evil\n
So Enjoy It How\0
Yes, Kardis stirs. I sense her\n
presence. She grows more\n
powerful with each passing hour.\n
I can lead you to her, but first\n
you must do something for me.
\sI Would Like It\n
Thee Hunt Heads\n
Ruselb And Then\n
Shoedle Welcome\0
Ruselb, leader of the Dark\n
Elves, and Shoedle, high priest\n
of Falaris, have both dishonored\n
me. Bring me their heads and I\n
will aid you.
Narse wishes for you to kill\n
these people? It is not an easy\n
request.\0
Narse sleeps again. If you want\n
his help, you must complete his\n
mission.\0
Wake the dragon.
Narse is sleeping. The Temple of\n
Darkness can be reached via a\n
trail from the lower level of\n
this cave. There you will find\n
Shoedle.\0
Wake the dragon.
Tell me about Shoedle.
I have not met him personally,\n
but I hear that he is a master of\n
the petrification curse. He\n
lives in the Temple of Darkness\n
to the north.\0
Narse is sleeping. Ruselb, the\n
leader of the Dark Elves, is in\n
the Forest of Darkness. You must\n
bring Narse his head.\0
Wake the dragon.
How long will you stay here?
Wart wishes me to remain here\n
until you have met the demands\n
of Narse.\0
Very well.\0
Black Dragon Narse, awake. You\n
have visitors. Grant us an\n
audience.\n
 \sDark Narse Awake To Talk\n
With Us\0
\sWhats Up Guys\n
Im Very Hungry\n
Could Thee Be\n
My Dinner Huh\0
Who disturbs my slumber? Ah, it\n
is the humans again. What is it\n
this time?\0
I offer you the head of Shoedle, great Narse.
\sMe Will Take It\0
I thank you mortal.
\sExact Me Got\n
Shoedle Head Ya\0
Shoedle is dead. He has paid for\n
his theft. My honor has been\n
avenged.
\sExact Me Got\n
Shoedle Head Ya\n
Last Ruselb\n
Waiting Offer\0
You have brought me the head of\n
Shoedle. Now I wait only for the\n
head of Ruselb.
Great Narse, I present my sacrifice to you.\nThe head of the Dark Elf Ruselb!
\sMe Will Take It\0
I thank you mortal. Ruselb has\n
paid for his crime. My honor is\n
avenged.
\sExact Me Got\n
Ruselb Head Ya\0
Ruselb has paid for his\n
treachery. My honor is avenged. 
\sExact Me Got\n
Ruselb Head Ya\n
Last Shoedle\n
Waiting Offer\0
Now bring me the head of\n
Shoedle.
I wish to destroy Kardis, Goddess of\nDestruction.
My task is done. Underneath\n
Conquera Castle lies the temple\n
of Kardis, where the Goddess\n
sleeps restrained in a prison of\n
ice.\0
At the far western side of Marmo,\n
beyond the desert, through the\n
ruins and up into the mountains\n
you fill find Conquera Castle.\0
Take care of yourself, brave one.\n
I will pray for your success.\0
\sThe Heads Can\n
Give Thee Permit\0
Once I have both their heads I\n
will guide you to Kardis!
\sThee Got Leave\n
Should Do Have\n
Skull Statue\n
Usher In Castle\0
I will now fashion for you a key\n
that will allow you to enter\n
Conquera Castle.
\sWo There Is That\n
Entrance At West\n
End Of The World\n
Thee Must Go Cu\0
Head southwest from the desert\n
down to the ruins, then north\n
into the mountains. There you\n
will find the entrance to\n
Conquera.

Welcome, hero! I am the spirit of\n
Mithrill. I will train you in the\n
use of the Pickaxe.\0
To engrave powerful Ancients you\n
need plenty of Mithrill. The\n
quantity you get from killing\n
monsters is not enough!\0
Take a look at the bottom of your\n
item bar. The icon that just\n
appeared is the Pickaxe.\0
Select it with the D-Pad keys\n
like you would with the Lockpick\n
and use it with the Y-button.\0
All around Marmo are large\n
clusters of raw Mithrill like\n
this one. The Pickaxe will break\n
these clusters down into smaller\n
collectable pieces.\0
Each Pickaxe can only be used\n
once, like the Lockpick. So be\n
sure to carry plenty.\0
Take this Pickaxe. Once you have\n
it, your blacksmith should be\n
able to DUPLICATE more for you.\0
Happy digging!\0
Fancy a Pickaxe? Then clear some\n
space in your inventory and ask\n
again! \sCant Put It\0
Calm the angry dragon and return\n
to this monument! \sCant Start\n

To enter the temple of Darkness,\n
you must destroy the four\n
Falaris statues located on these\n
hills.\sIts Danger Trap\0
If you continue here you must be\n
able to bear 240 tortures in\n
order to open the seal. \sYou\n
Will Die\0
If you kill the gate keeper you\n
must be able to bear 350\n
tortures to reach the\n
teleporter. \sYou Will Die\0
Great Myrii, God of War, crush\n
those who oppose us with your\n
iron hammer!\n
 \sSine Kon Tikusho\0
You walked right into their\n
trap! I'm glad we came in time to\n
help.\0
\p, wait! Before you go any\n
further we must speak with you.\0
What do you want?
You are on your way to fight\n
Shoedle? I wish to help! Take me\n
with you!\0
You cannot fight. How could you be of use to\nme?
It is too dangerous for you Leila.
Slayn is a powerful wizard. I wish for him to\naccompany me.
Very well, Leila, you can come with me.
I may not be a great warrior, but\n
Marfa, the Goddess of Creation,\n
is protecting me.\0
I can heal you and cleanse the\n
souls of the servants of\n
darkness who we face. Please\n
take me with you.\0
I think it would be wise to allow\n
one of us to accompany you.\0
I do not need either of you! Get out of my\nway!
If I must, I wish to take Slayn.
If I must, I with to take Leila.
Heh heh heh. It is decided then. I\n
will journey with you into the\n
Temple of Darkness.\0
Take good care of yourself\n
Slayn.\0
Don't I always?\0
I will wait for you both in\n
Narse's cave. May Marfa protect\n
you!\0
Ok \p, let's get going.\n
Shoedle awaits.\0
You will not regret this.\0
Take care of yourself, Leila.\0
Don't worry, Slayn. I will be\n
careful. I promise.\0
I hope so. I will wait for you\n
both in Narse's cave.\0
Let's go. There is no time to\n
waste.\0
You are stubborn, hero. Very\n
well, I hope you know what you\n
are doing.\0
We shall return to Narse's cave\n
and pray for your victory.\0
The door is locked! Hmmm, I\n
wonder if it has anything to do\n
with those four statues...\0
These four statues hold the key\n
to this door. They look very\n
fragile to me...\0

 }E^
A few days ago a knight of Valis\n
ventured into this temple\n
looking for Shoedle.\0
Shoedle suspended him by his\n
entrails and skinned him from\n
head to toe.\0
The knight suffered in\n
unimaginable agony for days\n
before Shoedle finally allowed\n
him to die. It was a very bad\n
death.\0
My name is Serafi. I have been\n
waiting for you. Shoedle insists\n
I welcome all visitors\n
personally.\0
Where is Shoedle?
What was a knight of Valis doing here?
Is Shoedle so afraid that he would send a\nchild.
Shoedle is on the 4th level of\n
this temple. I will take you\n
there... once your bodies are\n
cold and dead.\0
Didn't you know? The holy\n
knights of Valis have come from\n
Lodoss to prevent the\n
resurrection of Kardis.\0
They are all dead now though.\n
What a pity Parn was not with\n
them, I would of liked to have\n
heard him scream.\0
How can a child speak such\n
things?!\0
How can a child speak such\n
things?\0
I am a child of Falaris. Shoedle\n
took me in and taught me the ways\n
of Darkness. I belong to him now.\0
This 
child
 is more than a match\n
for you! Even my pets are more\n
than a match for you!\0
In fact, allow me to introduce\n
you to one of them.\0
Dahl! Come out! I have some new\n
friends for you to play with! \0
Not enough? How about some more\n
of my pets?\0
Try not to die too quickly. My\n
pets need their excercise.\0
 KEO
 dEh
^XP"
^xP"
_$M"
You killed my pets! You are no\n
hero. You are a murderer. I see it\n
in your eyes. You enjoy killing.\0
It is as Shoedle said. You have\n
come to assassinate him. But I\n
will not let you.\0
Why do you wish to fight us?
Child or not, oppose me and I will destroy\nyou.
Let us pass child.
You invade my home, slaughter my\n
pets and intend to kill both me\n
and my master, and you ask why I\n
wish to fight you?\0
I fight to defend all that is\n
dear to me, destroyer!\0
I know you will. I see the\n
darkness in your eyes. You have a\n
black heart. But I am not scared\n
of you, murderer.\0
I will not try to stop you. But\n
there is someone here who feels\n
differently.\0
Vival, welcome our guests!\0
TD()08
>E()08
 }Eh
So, now you have come for me\n
destroyer.\0
We do not wish to harm you.\n
Please let us pass.\0
You only say that because you\n
are afraid of me.\0
We do not wish to harm you. Let\n
us pass.\0
This is no time for games, child.
Do not underestimate me because\n
of my age. I am a disciple of\n
Falaris. I command the powers of\n
darkness.\0
Then you are a servant of evil.
Perhaps. Evil favors the strong.\n
And now I think it's time to find\n
out just how strong you really\n
are.\0
Death to the destroyer!\0
It appears that you are also a\n
servant of evil, destroyer.\0
You have beaten me. I have failed\n
my master. But you will not find\n
Shoedle so easy to defeat.\0
Behold his powers.\0
Now do you understand? You\n
cannot defeat Shoedle. He is too\n
powerful, even for you.\0
I respect your strength. Turn\n
back now, for your own good.\n
Before it is too...\0
.... late. Why?... master...\0
Poor child! So this is how\n
Shoedle treats his servants? He\n
must be stopped.\0
He paid the ultimate price for\n
failure. But he was just a child.\n
Shoedle must be stopped.\0
EUg59
>BD"
Well, well, well. You made here it\n
after all! What fun!\0
But... you forced me to kill my\n
little Serafi. And that makes me\n
sad.\0
No-one forced you to do anything,\n
murderer. Serafi was just a\n
child.\0
You are a child killer and you\n
will pay for your crimes, dark\n
priest.\0
I have come for your head Shoedle.
For my head?! Sorry, but I'm\n
afraid I'm rather attatched to\n
it! Now yours on the other hand...\0
Back for more? Come to me my\n
children...\0
Time to die!\0
Shoedle is protected by some\n
kind of shield. We cannot hurt\n
him now. We must retreat and find\n
the source of his power.\0

My friend, wait! You have come a\n
long way and you are close to\n
your goal. But there is still one\n
last opponent you must face.\0
Who, Wart?
It is Karla, the Grey Witch. She\n
has been Wagnard's silent\n
partner all along, supporting\n
him from the shadows.\0
She caused the storm which sank\n
the ship from Lodoss, and helped\n
Wagnard acquire the relics he\n
needed to resurrect Kardis.\0
Be careful my friend. She is a\n
cunning adversary. She will try\n
to reason with you and turn you\n
against me.\0
Nothing she could say will change my path.
If you are worried, then join me Wart!
Do not underestimate Karla. She\n
has manipulated events in Lodoss\n
for more than 500 years.\0
Indeed, the events that lead to\n
your last death were\n
orchestrated by Karla.\0
Unfortunately, I cannot. I have a\n
binding agreement with Karla. We\n
cannot directly challenge one\n
another.\0
Do not underestimate Karla. She\n
has manipulated events in Lodoss\n
for more than 500 years.\0
Well perhaps I should orchestrate HER\ndeath.
There is something you're not telling me...
No! You must not kill her!\n
Karla is a powerful sorceress,\n
and has long been protected by\n
an immortal curse.\0
If you kill her, she will\n
exorcise your soul and take\n
possesion of your body. This is\n
how she has lived for 500 years.\0
How can I defeat her if I cannot kill her?
I will enchant your weapon so\n
that a killing blow will instead\n
be transformed into a mortal\n
wound.\0
There. It is done. You will not be\n
able to kill Karla, but you can\n
incapacitate her.\0
Good luck, my friend. May the\n
Gods be with you.\0
At last me meet. Or should I say,\n
we meet again?\0
The great emperor Beld,\n
reincarnated! Such audacity!\n
Wart took a great risk bringing\n
you back.\0
You don't remember me at all, do\n
you? I fought alongside you when\n
you invaded Lodoss.\0
Lets cut to the chase, witch.
You orchestrated my death.
What do you know of my past life?
Is that what Wart told you? It is\n
true, after a fashion. I rallied\n
you to arms against your life\n
long friend, King Farn.\0
But you killed one another. I did\n
not interfere with the battle.\n
Your death was your own, as was\n
your life.\0
But that was a long time ago. It\n
has nothing to do with who I am\n
today, or indeed, who you are.\0
I know you better than you know\n
youself. I have been your ally\n
and your enemy. I have saved your\n
life and yes, I have betrayed\n
you.\0
But no worse than Wart. Did he\n
tell you what will happen to you\n
if you actually defeat Kardis?\0
I'll ride off into the sunset and live\nhappily ever after?
Ha ha ha. I thought so.\0
When you confront the Goddess of\n
Destruction, win or loose, you\n
will die. This has been your\n
destiny from the start.\0
You lie witch!
Do I? Did Wart tell you that I\n
was the one who granted you\n
life? He borrowed from me the\n
relics which he used to raise\n
you from the dead.\0
The conditions of your new life\n
are clear. You live, but only\n
long enough to complete your\n
mission.\0
Your will is your blood. Your\n
desire to kill Kardis is what\n
sustains your life. You are in a\n
no win situation.\0
If Kardis kills you, you will die\n
in a place where not even Wart's\n
magic can reach you. No-one will\n
find your body.\0
But if you kill Kardis, your\n
desire will vanish, and your\n
life with it. It is a tragic\n
predicament to be sure.\0
Then die once again, Beld!\0
Rise, Ruselb!\0
Rise, Shoedle!\0
Finish it. Kill me!\0
I wish I could.
Wart's magic will not allow me to kill you.
Stop with these games! It is Wart\n
isn't it? He restrains you from\n
killing me.\0
Wart is smarter than I give him\n
credit for. In this state I\n
cannot oppose you. \0
If you had killed me, I would\n
continue to live in your body.\0
I have controlled the destiny of\n
Lodoss for 500 years. I only wish\n
to retain a balance of good and\n
evil.\0
You leave me in a position where\n
I cannot influence the outcome\n
of this battle. The fate of\n
Lodoss rests in your hands now.\0
But I do not lie Beld. No matter\n
what the outcome with Kardis,\n
you will die. It is your destiny.\0
Your only choice is to turn back\n
now.\0
But... I know that you will not\n
heed me, no matter what the cost.\n
So be it. Have a nice death\n
hero...\0
Well done! Well done indeed! Now\n
nobody will disturb your final\n
confrontation with Kardis.\0
Wart is it true? I am destined to die?
Karla is no longer a threat, help me Wart!
I suppose I should thank you.
I go to face my destiny.
I will return to the Goblin\n
Fortress and pray for a miracle.\n
May the Gods smile on you this\n
day.\0
Is that what Karla told you? My\n
friend, I will not lie to you. It\n
is your destiny.\0
Is there no other way?
I do not fear death. I am ready for my fate.
You must fight Kardis. You\n
cannot escape your destiny. Even\n
if you leave now, eventually you\n
will have to face the Goddess.\0
All men die. To the cowardly man\n
the question is 
when?
 To the\n
brave man the question is 
how?
In your last life your\n
achievements were great. Even\n
now the name Beld is remembered\n
with fear and respect.\0
Yet if you defeat Kardis, live or\n
die, your achievements of this\n
life will far surpass that of\n
your previous incarnation.\0
Your power is great, perhaps\n
great enough to destroy a God.\n
You must at least try.\0
You are truly brave my friend.\n
Not even death holds any fear\n
for you. You are a king among\n
men.\0
I am sorry, but I cannot assist\n
you. My magic would not work\n
inside the Temple of Kardis. \0
I would be nothing but a useless\n
old man! I'm afraid you must face\n
your destiny alone.\0
It is I who should be thanking\n
you. You have risen to the call\n
of adventure and overcome all\n
challenges.\0
I thank you from the bottom of my\n
heart. My greatest joy is to see\n
you succeed, savior of Marmo.\0

Ashram! Look out!\0
My lord, I have brought the\n
warrior with red hair, as you\n
requested.\0
Thank you, Pirotess. Well done.\0
So you are \p. We meet at\n
last. My name is Ashram,\n
commander of the armies of\n
Marmo. I have heard a lot about\n
you.\0
Your victory over Ruselb and\n
Shoedle is remarkable. You are\n
clearly a warrior of significant\n
power.\0
Which is exactly why I have need\n
of your services. Of course, I\n
shall reward you admirably.\0
I take orders from no-one!
I do not think that you can afford my\nservices
That depends on what it is you want me to do.
Of course you don't! I would\n
expect no less from one who\n
intends to slay a Goddess!\0
But you do not know what I offer.\n
I realize the services of one\n
who intends to slay a Goddess\n
cannot come cheaply!\0
Of course it does! You are wise\n
as well as powerful. But do not\n
worry, my task coincides with\n
your mission to stop Kardis.\0
I wish to kill the dark priest\n
Wagnard. He betrayed both me and\n
the people of Marmo. He must pay\n
for his treachery.\0
How do you know I intend to stop Kardis?
You have a loose tongue Ashram. Perhaps I\nshall remove it.
My affairs do not concern you.
Pirotess told me of your plans. I\n
do not believe that you will\n
succeed, but your courage is\n
exemplary.\0
We share a common enemy, you and\n
I. Someone who we would both\n
benefit from seeing removed.\0
The dark priest Wagnard?
Exactly. He betrayed me and the\n
people of Marmo. He intends to\n
resurrect Kardis for his own\n
selfish means.\0
Help me to eliminate Wagnard! He\n
stands in both our ways.\n
Together I am confident we can\n
defeat the sorcerer.\0
Wait! It makes no sense for us to\n
fight. We share a common enemy.\n
Someone we both wish to see\n
removed.\0
Oh but they do.\0
Alright. We will work together to defeat\nWagnard.
I travel alone. You would only slow me down.
That depends on the reward doesn't it?
A wise decision. I am glad you\n
understand. We will see Wagnard\n
dead before the day is through.\0
Pirotess, \p and I will\n
track down Wagnard. Return to\n
the docks and...\0
No! Take me with you! I want to\n
help you fight!\0
Pirotess, I need you to continue\n
overseeing the evacuation.\n
Besides, it is too dangerous for\n
you.\0
I can take care of myself. You\n
know that. I won't leave you\n
Ashram...\0
Pirotess, return to the docks\n
immediately! That is an order!\0
Lighten up Ashram. She can take care of\nherself.
Ashram is right. This is no place for a\nwoman.
I know that. Pirotess, please\n
understand. I don't want\n
anything to happen to you...\0
Very well Ashram. I shall obey.\n
Be careful.\0
\p, thank you for\n
everything. I hope we meet again\n
someday.\0
Goodbye, \p. We will not\n
meet again.\0
I'm afraid I must insist.\0
Alright. We will work together to defeat\nWagnard.
Well in that case, my price just doubled.
Greed... I like that in a man!\n
However, all I can offer you at\n
this moment is what I have on me.\0
I have a magic resistant cape\n
and a magic ring which increases\n
attack speed. Which would you\n
prefer?\0
I'll take the magic ring.
Magic cape sounds good.
Give me both, or loose your life!
Actually, I quite like the look of your\nsword!
So you want my magic ring? This\n
will greatly increase the\n
striking speed of your weapon.\n
Here, take it!\0
Our negotiations are at a close.\0
So you want the magic cape? This\n
will protect you from Wagnard's\n
magic. Here, take it!\0
Ha ha ha! If that is what it will\n
take to secure your services, so\n
be it.\0
I cannot part with this sword.\n
Soul Crusher is too valuable.\n
But I can give you a similar\n
weapon, almost as good.\0
Ok, let's get moving. We don't\n
want to keep Wagnard waiting!\0
Welcome to Conquera. I am the\n
Guardian of this floor, as long\n
as I remain alive this barrier\n
cannot be passed.\0
You will never.. wait a minute.\n
The hero AND Ashram? No-one said\n
anything about there being two\n
of them! Ack! Servants! Help!\0
Ok guys, take 'em down. I'll just,\n
er, be in the other room, you\n
know, 'cheering you on. ' Yes,\n
that sounds good! \0
You killed them all? You killed\n
them all! Ulp! I think I'll just\n
stay in here for now.\0
Argh! They're here! And there's\n
nowhere to run! Servants, help!\n
Help! Save me!\0

I see you made it this far alive.\n
Not bad for a human.\0
Welcome to Conquera Castle,\n
although in recent times it has\n
come to be known as the Dark\n
Castle.\0
I am glad you made it. Now I can\n
repay my debt to you. I wish to\n
introduce you to someone.\0
How do I know this isn't a trap?
What happened to this castle?
Pirotess, you owe me nothing.
Very well. Lets go.
I swear on my honor as a Dark Elf\n
that this is no trap. That must\n
suffice for now.\0
When Wagnard awoke Kardis the\n
castle filled with the dark\n
spawn of the Goddess. The\n
inhabitants were massacred.\0
I cannot wait to meet this Wagnard.
He acts as if he is the ruler of\n
Conquera now. He is willing to\n
sacrifice all Marmo to obtain\n
the blessing of Kardis.\0
You rescued Marela at my\n
request. I promised you then\n
that I would repay you. I am a\n
woman of my word.\0
There is an exit on this floor to\n
the outer perimeter of the\n
castle. This is our primary\n
destination.\0
The exit is just beyond. Stay\n
close to the walls, the floor\n
holds traps.\0
Destroy the throne! There is a\n
secret staircase beneath it.\0
The sun protects the forest, the\n
forest protects the earth, the\n
earth protects the sea and the\n
sea protects the night. If you\n
destroy the night you will see\n
my true form.\0
I am the guardian of this floor\n
and... what? Why are you\n
laughing? Yes I know I'm small.\n
So what?\0
Size isn't everything you know.\n
There are a lot of advantages to\n
being small.\0
You're probably wondering how a\n
little guy like me got to become\n
a Floor Guardian for Kardis?\0
Well I'll let you in on a little\n
secret. I'm not your average\n
Shadow Stalker.\0
I've got powers I have. Special\n
powers. It's true. I was born with\n
them.\0
Bet you want to know what my\n
powers are, don't you? How about\n
a little demonstration then.\n
Attack me!\0
Ha! Take that!\0
That's right baby. I can freeze\n
anybody I want. Root 'em to the\n
spot! Pretty cool, huh?\0
Unfortunately, it takes me a\n
little time to recharge after\n
each use. I can't just keep\n
freezing people continuously.\0
What's more, I need total\n
concentration while I am\n
recharging. Any kind of\n
distraction and I have to start\n
again.\0
Well enough talk. Its time to\n
show you what this 'little guy'\n
can do. Wave one, come out.\0
Let's get it on!\0
Not bad! But that was just the\n
appetizer. Lets see how you do\n
with the main course. Wave 2, on\n
deck!\0
Party time!\0
Wow, you guys are really strong!\n
There's only thing for it! All\n
waves, attack!\0
For Kardis!\0
I am all alone. Looks like I'm\n
done for. But I'll still fight to\n
the death.\0
Ouch...\0
Here it comes!\0
Take that!\0
Damn it. Now I have to start from\n
the beginning again.\0

Welcome my old masters! How do\n
you like what I've done with your\n
castle? Or should I say, MY\n
castle. I think the place has\n
never looked better.\0
Welcome old masters. How do you\n
like what I've done with your\n
castle? Or I should I say, MY\n
castle. I think the place has\n
never looked better.\0
Your castle? This castle was\n
built by emperor Beld, betrayer!\0
Ashram, I'm surprised to see you\n
here. I thought you'd already\n
fled the island with your tail\n
between your legs.\0
You were far to easy to deceive\n
Ashram. So idealistic and\n
trusting. Fool! I used you like I\n
used Beld.\0
Silence wizard. Prepare yourself\n
for your fate!\0
What? You think you can hurt me?\n
I have invoked the power of\n
Kardis. I am the strongest I've\n
ever been! Let me show you.\0
Manifest, minions of Kardis. Her\n
loyal servant commands you.\0
See? As Kardis awakens my powers\n
go stronger by the minute.\0
But I must admit I am a little\n
shocked to see the reincarnation\n
of Beld before me. Wart is\n
trickier than I thought.\0
Still, you died once Beld, and\n
you WILL die again.\0
Enough trickery wizard. You're going down!
Do you know me?
What do you hope to gain from resurrecting\nKardis?
Certainly. I can read your aura -\n
you are the reincarnation of\n
emperor Beld. Both Ashram and I\n
used to serve you.\0
Such lies! I saw Beld die in\n
battle with King Farn. How could\n
this man be Beld? \0
Because Wart resurrected him you\n
idiot! You know, there really\n
isn't that big a difference\n
between what Wart did and what I\n
did.\0
We both resurrected powerful\n
forces from the past to serve\n
our individual purposes. Our\n
intentions and methods are the\n
same.\0
Simple. I need the blessing of\n
Kardis to become a God myself. I\n
wish to rule over life and death.\0
Neither of you guessed my true\n
intentions. I played you both\n
like pawns. But now the game is\n
at an end...\0
How dare you insult our dead\n
master! You were once his loyal\n
servant!\0
I fought on both your sides only\n
to obtain the relics that I\n
needed to resurrect Kardis. I am\n
loyal to no-one but myself.\0
Cry havoc and let slip the dogs\n
of war!\0
Your destruction is at hand!\0
R#S#T#U#V#W#X#Y#Z#[#\#]#^#_#`#a#b#c#d#e#f#g#h#i#j#k#l#m#n#o#p#q#r#s#t#u#v#w#x#y#z#{#|#}#~#
Behold, \p! Conquera\n
Castle!\0
What was once a symbol of power\n
and respect during the reign of\n
emperor Beld is now a corrupt\n
vessel for unspeakable evil.\0
Under Beld and Ashram the castle\n
was the heart of a dream, a dream\n
for the unification of all\n
Lodoss. Now look at it.\0
I... I am sorry. I apologize for\n
my outburst. Emotion is a sign of\n
weakness, and these times call\n
for strength. \0
So shut up and lets get moving.
It's alright. Our emotions are what define\nus.
Yes, you are right. We must hurry.\n
I am sorry. \0
Thank you. You are kind, human. It\n
is not a trait I normally\n
associate with your species.\0
Wagnard! This is all his doing!\n
If he is not stopped he will\n
destroy Marmo.\0
Let us move on. My master is\n
waiting.\0

\p, I thank you for your\n
services. Wagnard is dead and my\n
task here is done. It is time for\n
me to leave.\0
Goodbye Ashram. God speed.
Where will you take your people?
Please say goodbye to Pirotess for me.
Goodbye Ashram. God Speed.
Where will you take your people?
We will leave Marmo and set sail\n
to the East, looking for a new\n
land a new kingdom to call home.\0
Although I know that it is\n
futile, I still ask that you come\n
with us. We could use a man like\n
you.\0
My destiny is with Kardis. I cannot come.
Sure. Come and get me when I have killed\nKardis.
Your courage is legendary. You\n
are one of the bravest men I have\n
ever known. But your enemy is a\n
Goddess!\0
You cannot win! A mortal cannot\n
kill a deity. You will fight, and\n
you will loose.\0
I have died once already. I am not afraid of\ndeath.
I suppose you must follow the\n
path you feel is right, no matter\n
where it leads. I respect that.\0
What? Have you fallen for the\n
moody elf? I agree, she is quite\n
beguiling is she not.\0
I do have some feelings for her.
You mock me. I feel no love for Pirotess.
Unfortunately, Pirotess is in\n
love with me. I do not believe\n
she would reciprocate to another\n
admirer.\0
But I will pass on your thanks to\n
her, all the same.\0
I know. I was only jesting. I will\n
pass on your thanks to her.\0
Know this brave knight. I will\n
never forget you, or the battles\n
we fought together. Your memory\n
will live on.\0
Good luck and farwell.\0
We sleep eternal under the\n
protection of four evil god\n
statues...\n
We shall take the life of anyone\n
who wakes us from our sleep.\0
We three brothers protect this\n
staircase. You have woken us,\n
there will be no tomorrow for\n
you.\0
Wake up, my brothers! Someone\n
wishes to pass!\0
It's clobbering time!\0
Dedicate yourself to the flames\n
of Marfa that burn cool. If you\n
survive you will be worthy of\n
the shield of Marfa.\0
The test begins. Count the\n
seconds. Do not leave the flame!\0

Caught you red handed thief! You\n
walked right into my trap!\0
You have found Marfa's Armor but\n
you will never leave this room\n
alive.\0
As long as I live this door shall\n
remain sealed. But don't worry, I\n
won't leave you alone in there.\0
Welcome, mortal! I have been\n
looking forward this. Let me\n
introduce you to my children.\0
Adorable, aren't they? My\n
children and I share a special\n
bond.\0
For as long as they live, you\n
cannot hurt me!\0
Also, I like to take good care of\n
my children. I have special\n
healing powers.\0
Even if you wound them, I will\n
give them their life back.\0
Now, let the games begin.\0
Noooo!\0
My children! My poor children!\n
You will suffer for this\n
outrage!\0
Sisters, surround him!\0
Just die!\0
You idiot! For as long as my\n
children live you cannot hurt\n
me.\0
Under the protection of the\n
three god statues I will sleep\n
eternally. A major misfortune\n
will befall he who wakes me.\0

Welcome, Beld. You look\n
surprised to see me alive! Ah,\n
but I am not alive. Neither am I\n
dead. In truth I am undead.\0
You wanted to know why I wished\n
to resurrect Kardis. This is why!\n
She has given me the ultimate\n
power, power over life and death!\0
For how can you kill what does\n
not live? Follow me young Beld.\n
Let the final confrontation\n
commence!\0
It is time for you to return to\n
the Realm of the Dead.\0
Power! Unlimited power! The\n
power over life and death! That\n
is what I seeked. That is what I\n
have been granted.\0
But to obtain the ultimate power\n
I had to make the ultimate\n
sacrifice. Fool, you do not\n
realize that you did me a favor.\0
Are you saying that you let yourself be\nkilled?
I do not wish to converse with a corpse.
Now you are getting it.\n
Look who's talking!\n
I died to become King of the Dead,
to receive the ultimate power of\n
eternal life. Why did you die?\0
This is the point of no return.\n
If you continue any further you\n
will die. That is your fate. Be\n
grateful for this last piece of\n
advice!\0
Goddess of Destruction, grant me\n
power! Grant me power beyond\n
life, power beyond death, power\n
beyond imagination!\0
No! More power! I need MORE POWER!\n
Possess me Kardis. Fill my soul\n
with darkness! I AM READY!\0
Ahhhhhhhh!\0
Tremble, enemy of Kardis. Your\n
destruction is at hand.\0
Come out, my servants!\0
I will devour your soul!\0
\c0xc
The Goddess of Destruction hid\n
four sacred items beneath four\n
divine pillars of fire.\0
The first divine pillar. Here\n
lies the helmet of Kardis. He who\n
destroys this pillar will feel\n
the wrath of the Goddess.\0
The second divine pillar. Here\n
lies the Shield of Kardis. He who\n
destroys this pillar feel the\n
wrath of the Goddess. \0
The third divine pillar. Here\n
lies the Armor of Kardis. He who\n
destroys this pillar feel the\n
wrath of the Goddess.\0
The fourth divine pillar. Here\n
lies the sacred wand of fire. He\n
who destroys this pillar will\n
feel the wrath of Kardis.\0

When I was young a terrible\n
green dragon came to Marmo and\n
terrified the population.\0
The ancestors of the Dark Elves\n
made huge sacrifices, but\n
finally they sealed the dragon\n
in an enchanted prison.\0
To be sure the dragon could not\n
escape, they transmuted the key\n
into 30 sacred medallions and\n
hid them all around Marmo.\0
I know that what Ruselb did was\n
wrong. He had chosen to serve\n
Kardis, and his destruction was\n
his own providence.\0
But I am still his Grandmother,\n
and the last of his kin. It is my\n
blood duty to avenge him.\0
I am old and weak. I could not\n
possibly defeat you. But I know\n
of something that can.\0

Incarnation of evil, I present\n
to you the key to your prison!\0
You are free! All I ask in return\n
is that you destroy this man\n
that stands before you.\0

I am protected by the power of\n
the dragon. You cannot hurt me.\0
H.. how?...\0
It... it isn't possible!\0
I.. I don't believe it! How can\n
this be?\0
Even though you did not heed my\n
warning, you fought the dragon\n
and won! Who are you? What are\n
you? Are you a God?\0
Marela is close to death. She\n
shared life with the dragon to\n
make it stronger. Its death has\n
mortally wounded her.\0
However, I believe I could still\n
save her, if you so wish. But it\n
is your decision.\0
Please, save her, if you can.
Let her die. It is all she deserves.
You are merciful as well as\n
mighty. If you are a God, you are\n
like no God I have ever known.\0
Very well. I will tend to poor\n
Marela's wounds as best I can.\0
Very well. If that is what you\n
wish, she will meet her fate\n
alone.\0
Now let us leave this place and\n
return to the village of the\n
Dark Elves.\0
This is not possible. How can\n
this be? It was an ancient\n
dragon and you are but a\n
mortal...\0
I am sorry Ruselb. I am old, and I\n
have failed you. I will surely\n
join you now.\0
Ruselb, forgive me! My last wish\n
was to avenge you and I have\n
failed. I will surely join you\n
now.\0

Why are you collecting the\n
sacred medallions, \p?\0
Do you actually know what they\n
are? Or what they are capable\n
of? I think Marela has deceived\n
you. \0
If I were you, I would only give\n
her 29 of the 30 coins. That is my\n
advice. Take it or leave it.\0
Anyway, you are wasting precious\n
time. You must come to Conquera\n
Castle. There is someone I want\n
you to meet.\0

Such a weak species as man\n
should not be granted an\n
audience with one as great as my\n
master.\0
If you really insist, then we\n
will test you to see if you are\n
worthy of my master's attention.\n
Knock at any time!\0
You passed my guards. You have my\n
attention. What do you want\n
human?\0
I promised Marela I would being her all 30\nsacred medallions.
I am here for your treasure.
Marela? The Dark Elf? Strange\n
that she should seek such a\n
prize.\0
Listen to me human. I do not know\n
what she has told you, but all\n
these medallions hold is misery\n
and suffering.\0
Unless it is your intention to\n
unleash an unspeakable evil upon\n
Marmo?\0
Of course you are. That is what\n
everyone comes here looking for.\n
However, I have orders to guard\n
this treasure with my life.\0
Listen to me human, my medallion\n
if of no consequence to you. All\n
it is good for is bringing\n
misery and suffering.\0
If you heed my warning and leave\n
now, I promise I will not hurt\n
you.\0
Do you believe that a warrior like me fears\nsuch a threat?
Alright, keep you horns on. I'm going.
Not really. If you knew who I\n
really was you never would have\n
come in here.\0
This is your last chance. Leave\n
now or face my wrath.\0
Funny, that's exactly what I was going to\nsay.
Alright, keep your horns on. I'm going.
A wise decision! As promised I\n
will let you leave unscathed.\0
But if you ever set foot in this\n
dungeon again, I shall know no\n
mercy. Remember that.\0
A dead brave man is still a dead\n
man! You will get your wish\n
mortal! Perish!\0
I warned you mortal...\0
But if you are so eager to die,\n
who am I stop you.\0
Well done. But do not celebrate\n
just yet.\0
Come to me, my loyal servants!\0
Prepare yourself for your fate!\0
You have passed the tested of\n
strength.\0
You have passed the test of\n
stamina.\0
