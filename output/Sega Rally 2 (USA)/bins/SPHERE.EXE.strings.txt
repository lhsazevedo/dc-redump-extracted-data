Generic failure.
Height of rectangle provided is not a multiple of reqd alignment.
The CooperativeLevel HWND has already been set. It can not be reset while the process has surfaces or palettes created.
HWND used by DirectDraw CooperativeLevel has been subclassed, this prevents DirectDraw from restoring state.
This surface can not be restored because it is an implicitly created surface.
Unable to match primary surface creation request with existing primary surface.
One or more of the caps bits passed to the callback are incorrect.
DirectDraw does not support the provided cliplist.

Create function called without DirectDraw object method SetCooperativeLevel being called.
No DC was ever created for this surface.
No DirectDraw ROP hardware.
A hardware-only DirectDraw object creation was attempted but the driver did not support any hardware.
Software emulation not available.
Operation requires the application to have exclusive mode but the application does not have exclusive mode.
Flipping visible surfaces is not supported.
There is no GDI present.
Clipper notification requires an HWND or no HWND has previously been set as the CooperativeLevel HWND.
Operation could not be carried out because there is no hardware present or available.
Returned when GetOverlayPosition is called on an overlay that UpdateOverlay has never been called on to establish a destination.
Operation could not be carried out because there is no overlay hardware present or available.

Surface was not locked.  An attempt to unlock a surface that was not locked at all, or by this process, has been attempted.
The surface being used is not a palette-based surface.
Operation could not be carried out because there is no hardware support for vertical blank synchronized operations.
Operation could not be carried out because there is no hardware support for zbuffer blitting.
Overlay surfaces could not be z layered based on their BltOrder because the hardware does not support z layering of overlays.
The hardware needed for the requested operation has already been allocated.
DirectDraw does not have enough memory to perform the operation.
The hardware does not support clipped overlays.
Can only have ony color key active at one time for overlays.
Returned when GetOverlayPosition is called on a hidden overlay.
Access to this palette is being refused because the palette is already locked by another thread.
This process already has created a primary surface.
Region passed to Clipper::GetClipList is too small.
This surface is already attached to the surface it is being attached to.
This surface is already a dependency of the surface it is being made a dependency of.
Access to this surface is being refused because the surface is already locked by another thread.
Access to surface refused because the surface is obscured.
Access to this surface is being refused because the surface memory is gone. The DirectDrawSurface object representing this surface should have Restore called on it.
